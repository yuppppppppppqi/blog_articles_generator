But surely the massage is comparable around. What is nice here is ambience and gives you a relaxing environment and private space. Best isnthe staff- friendly, courteous and honest that i left my watch in the massage room and they kept it for me even i came back a week after to claim it they still kept it safely. Thank you 	massage is great, espsecially the shop is close at 3am. very good for relax at midnigt. 	Thank you Grand massage and Spa I got your The grandset package  I like your quality service I highly recommend to everyone there is 1 guy in staff Suleman they're very kind and humble We enjoyed the service alot.😊 … 	Very helpful staff and welcoming, most importantly the whole massage session was really relaxing and calming after a long day of shopping 👍🏻 … 	I had a bad experience during my recent visit. Though the atmosphere was pleasant, I found the massage itself to be less professional than I had hoped. Additionally, I was surprised that the worker did not leave the room while I was changing clothes, which felt uncomfortable.  Moreover, the tidying up was done so quickly that I was still in the room, and I wasn't assisted in cleaning off the oil after the session. I believe there is room for improvement in these areas to enhance the overall client experience. I will never revisit. 	I was really looking forward to my visit after reading all the great reviews, but unfortunately, it didn’t meet my expectations. I was paired with a therapist who seemed inexperienced, and it really affected the quality of the session. I had informed the reception about an injury beforehand, but I still had to remind the therapist three times to avoid that area before finally asking her to stop massaging this spot altogether (it was one of the time you wished you had taken a shorter massage!). At this price point, you would expect a much better attention to detail and overall experience. Hopefully, this feedback will help improve the experience for future clients. 	Great service and very attentive. The place is clean and tidy. Did a 2 hour foot massage after shopping and it was so relaxing.  A welcome drink and hot tea were provided before and after the massage. Will defn come again! 	Amazinggggggggg! Beautiful building. Everything is very clean and calming. Best massage I’ve had, highly recommend the hot oil scalp massage (it’ll mess up your hair but feels great and hydrates your hair). Will absolutely come back 	Grand massage & spa is a good place to get a Luxury service and the staff also humble best place to get some luxury quality massage 😉 … 	I've been to Thailand a few times now. This spa has good massage therapists. If you're in the area, you have options to choose from. I had the 60 minutes hot stone massage, and it was worth every baht. 	Oil massage, the masseur was inexperienced, unable converse in english.. not worth the money and time here..Suggest the owner to provide proper training and hiring experience staff. Disappointing. 	Beautiful experience, professional staff. Very competent. Perfect privacy in the private rooms. Quiet place. I will recommend to everyone.	It was quiet, the facilities were good, and the staff was friendly. I went to many massage parlors, but it was the most refreshing massage of all. I plan to go again tomorrow.	Thank you for your great service we really enjoyed alot great massage and kind staff 😊🙏🏻 … 	Best massage in BKK and Suleman  was very good with his knowledge and recommendations done by him, I was satisfied and feel very relaxed and calm. If anyone looking for massage go for grand massage 	One of the best massage ever I had in Bangkok and I’m really thankful to Mr salmon to giving a humble full service and hospitality… 	I got a great time here, took a good rest and have a foot massage. The environment here is so relaxing and soothing. 	Was a wonderful experience! The masseuse was amazing and was able to hit the right spots! 	they have excellent technique and their service is top-notch. totally worth it 	Thank you so much for your great service we like it a lot 🤗 …
