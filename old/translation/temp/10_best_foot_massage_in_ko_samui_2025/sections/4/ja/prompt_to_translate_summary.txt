Really good service, comfortable massage and yummy ginger tea and a bottle of water after the massage. The owner even helped us buy street food in front of the door! Also, the interior design is refreshing and bright - not as dark as some other places. Would 100% recommend! 	Deep thai massage seemed to be very popular so we gave it a shot as well. We were amazed. Very calming, but deep massage into tense muscles. Ning, the owner was my masseuse and she was amazing! The place is recently renovated and everything is very clean. They cleaned quickly after we finished, which gave me such a confidence it’s a proper place. At the end we were served with some fruits, water, biscuits and warm ginger tea. It was a delight! 💛 Proper real massage! Recomand this place! 	Really great massage, attitude, thoughtful staff and lovely owner! The building is beautiful, the atmosphere is so relaxing, and they serve delicious ginger tea. Now we get massages here all the time! 	Ning's has consistently provided the BEST massages we have ever received in Thailand or the UK. This is an absolute MUST visit. We schedule in a stop here whenever we travel through Koh Samui. The Thai Oil 1.5hour massage cost 700bht= £15. It was insanely good and my body feels so relaxed. Complimentary water and ginger tea are provided for you.  Ning has expanded to the upstairs unit too which means there is so much more capacity and space than before. Aircon units keep you cool whilst the colourful fabrics (also for sale 200bht=£4.30) keep you from the chill. The parlour always smells amazing and the gentle music aids in your relaxation.  Ning has created such a lovely, super clean atmosphere and you always feel like friends. This was our third visit and we have already booked a fourth. Please support this fantastic business as you will not be sorry🩵 	It was my second time yesterday and I had 1 hour full body massage and it has been a wonderful experience!  Biew is such a talented masseuse. I was so impressed and left feeling incredibly relaxed. I will definitely be booking more treatments with her.  It’s a lovely place, few staff but everyone is professional and friendly. We felt comfortable immediately for the first time I went with my partner and the massage relaxed me a lot! We’ll be back for sure! 	Excellent place! One of the best in Samui. We came a few times and it was great time after time. The design is really nice (they have a second floor that you can't see from the entrance), and they service is professional. 	Great massage place!  Had no trouble booking via WhatsApp. We enjoyed a Thai massage, which was deeply relaxing!  Professional and smiley ladies, and a great & very important detail - you can put your belongings under the massage table where you see them through the head-spot! (At least until you rotate to your back ;))	First class spa . Beautifully appointed . Relaxing atmosphere. Cleaned to a very high standard. Staff are well trained and very attentive. This is my wife Louise's 11 th massage in 9 weeks . Can't wait to come back next year ! Thank you Ning and staff . 	What a beautiful place with European, Greek decor. Very boho chic. Extremely clean, superb massage just amazing… my back which was hurting was healed! And really great experience of both the foot massages (we requested last ten minutes for the shoulder back and head). Everything was amazing. Must visit! 	#Don't waste your money or time, just go to another place. This was the worst foot massage experience I've ever had. The female therapist, who was tiny with long braids on both sides, didn’t even have the focus to do the massage properly. It was supposed to be a foot massage, but she never touched my feet. She only massaged my calves. When I asked her to focus on my ankles, she only massaged the area around my ankle bone ( lateral malleolus) . Ugh, I couldn't take it. To the owner, you need to make sure your staff can actually do the massage. Please, have this therapist retrained. 	The absolute best massage in the whole of Thailand. Extremely high standard!  I chose a 1 hour back and shoulder massage for 350 baht. The lady was highly skilled and extremely qualified.  After one minute she knew exactly where my problem areas were and targeted them accordingly. The massage was very firm and strong in the right areas (exactly as I requested).  I will recommend this place to everyone I know and I wish I lived closer!  * my boyfriend wished the foot massage focused more on the foot and less on the leg * shop is quite small but it’s Thailand after all 	Not a good experience, on arrival I was greeted by a woman with the worst look on her face. She looked at me like I stole her last dollar. Then the owner tried numerous times to upsell a much more expensive massage than I asked for which was a clear cash grab. I still proceeded, was taken upstairs by the lady with very bad attitude and exuding bad energy which is not wanted when trying to relax(whole idea of a massage) I then tried to explain where to massage 5 times but couldn't communicate in any English so I cut massage short before starting.  I then tried to explain to owner why and got more bad attitude and bad energy.. NO THANKS 	The only salon that charges same as all streets salons, but level is wow , they give you tea and banana, you select aroma oil - proper Spa for 400 ! Call in advance as they always busy! Enjoy 💓 … 	The staff were pure brilliant - friendly an' welcomin'. The massages were amazin' too We went five times on our trip 'cause they were that good. Relaxin' music an' a clean, professional place. If ye want a quality massage, check them out. They'll sort oot yer knots an' have ye feelin' great. 	I had a wonderful experience at Ning’s Home Massage. As I was rushing for a flight, Ning was lovely and accommodated my request for an early massage before the store’s official opening hours. She even used premium coconut oils and had a delightful selection of ginger tea and food for me after the massage. This homegrown business deserves everyone’s support! Definitely will come back in future❤️ 	I have been visiting Ning's home massage for 4 times in my first holiday in Ko Samui. The ladies are the nicest and make you feel at home right away. The massages here are the best and most relaxing. The place is clean and nicely decorated. Very calming and relaxing. Too bad I have to go. I will definitely come back if I am in Koh Samui. Thanks ladies for everything and hope to visit you again in the future! Bless you. 	Nadia is amazing I've been back twice, every time she knows just how strong each body part needs, she finds all the little areas that need attention. The best massage EVER. 	I was so disappointed by massage. I took sport massage (which is the most expensive) for 1.5 hours and the service was very bad in quality. Massage was not professional and not comprehensive. The pressure and techniques were inconsistent, as if the therapist was inexperienced in sports massage, so she just caused discomfort throughout.  I couldn’t normally communicate with specialist because she didn’t understand English. The only thing I could do is to ask her to switch to a more gentle massage to reduce the discomfort. As a result, the service ended up being a relaxing massage (but still very poor) rather than the deep, muscle-focused sports massage I paid for.  I feel very sad and disappointed. Instead of relieving muscle tension I was hoping for, the session left me feeling more discomfort than when I arrived.  The studio suggested me to come again for the same price. 	Shania’s thai massage with oil was excellent. My husband got back and neck massage and it was quite good also. The place is clean and refreshing. If you stay nearby you should definitely try here. 	We had an amazing 1-Hour Thai Massage. Loved the atmosphere and kindness of everyone. Will definitely come again!
