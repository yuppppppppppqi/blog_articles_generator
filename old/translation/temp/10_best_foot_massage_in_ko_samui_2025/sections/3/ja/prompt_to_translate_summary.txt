After getting a massage, I felt much better. The staff are true professionals, especially Noi. This is the most thorough and high-quality massage I’ve had in Thailand. Highly recommend! 	Rin was amazing.  She gave me the best massage ever.  Deep tissue 90 minutes, so good I went back twice.  Thankyou Rin.  You are very skilled and caring. I highly recommend Rin’s services.  My two sisters, Ruth and Lee, also had a massage. They will be leaving separate reviews.  Many thanks Valerie xx 	I loved the massage it was really good and it was an amazing experience. This massage is my favourite massage i ever had. The workers were really kind.💕 … 	Absolutely amazing!!!! I got the Thai + aroma and my partner got the hot oil massage. Absolutely incredible. The best massage we’ve had in Thailand. The masters and really skilled and applies amazing pressure and techniques. Very clean and modern place. Super professional and wonderful. Very relaxed!! Highly recommend. 	Great massage! I took the foot massage and my wife took the oiled Thai massage, we both liked it so much. We were next to each other although it was not the same massage type, what made the experience even better 😄 … 	What a great massage!! I had Nui as my masseuse, she was absolutely amazing!! She got all the pressure points at the same time it was relaxing. I highly recommend this massage place. 	Our first Thai massage in Thailand at Nakee was a great experience. We felt very well taken care of by the team and really enjoyed the massage. We booked the 90-minute traditional Thai massage and now feel completely relaxed and refreshed. We’d be happy to come back again in the next few days. 	Had a great massage really lovely lady and she had a lot to deal with bless her! I had huge knots in my shoulders and they are gone! Will definitely go back …. Thank you 	I’m suspicious of these 5 star reviews. This was the most low effort and low quality massage and it’s clear the therapists have no training whatsoever despite all the certificates plastered on the walls. My partner and I had a 60 min head massage and it was awful. No technique, just some repeated scratching here and there. And we had to put our head in their lap. Weird and uncomfortable.  The atmosphere was also not good. Lots of coughing and too many people squeezed into a small space. 	I had the oil massage for 2 hours and it was really amazing! The lady made me feel like a princess, the way she massaged me it was so smooth and soft then i felt asleep and felt like reborn again! Totally worth the price and every one there were so polite! 	Very nice and clean salon. And most inportant: Great massage! One of the best I ever had. I will certainly vome back here. . 	Booked a 90 minutes oil massage together with my husband. I had a really great massage and would give it a five star. However my husband had to tell his massage therapist twice that he didn’t want his private parts touched. Just a disgusting experience. 	Very nice place for a relaxing time!! We went there two times and each was better than the last. Mickey was an excellent masseuse. Everyone there is super helpful, the place is clean and they enjoy tending to you. 	Had a Perfect Thai foot massage! Everything is very clean and quiet, very friendly and the massage very good, they did upper leg as well and a little bis of shoulders in the end which was amazing! Definitely recommend 	We go there often as a couple and it's always great :) the therapist are attentive, make an effort and are really good at what they do! Prices are absolutely fair	Had the best massage with Noi! She catered the massage for pregnancy and this was by far the best massage I’ve ever received even compared to 5 star hotel massages. Would highly recommend! 	I had a neck and back massage with Rin. She is really fabulous. Very kind, always asked if the pressure is ok and she did a very good job. I always have a lot of pain in my neck and right now I feel really relaxed and have no more pain. Thank you for one of the best massages I had so far. 😊 If you go there ask for Rin. 😉 …	I have had massages with Khun SA on several occasions now, she truly understands my needs and works on my problem-areas, she is so caring and professional. I can truly recommend both Nakee and Khun SA to anyone. 	Best massage since i‘ve been to Thailand! Patch and Toy were so nice, very professional and did an excellent job on our massage. My husband and I felt very relaxed afterwards. 100% reccomend! The ladies were all very kind and the studio was clean and quite. Perfect ambiente. 	Me and my wife had two massages at their location. And we would have gone for more sessions if we had more time. Noi and Pet were superb! We had two massages back in Pucket and by far, it was better at Nakee in Koh Samui. Definitely recommended it you either want a more traditional Thai massage or a more relaxed one.
