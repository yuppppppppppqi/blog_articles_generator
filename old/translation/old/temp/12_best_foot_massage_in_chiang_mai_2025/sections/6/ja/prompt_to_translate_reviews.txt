From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was clean, calming, and incredibly welcoming. The staff made us feel comfortable right away, and the entire space had such a peaceful vibe.  The masseuses were truly outstanding—professional, attentive, and clearly very skilled at what they do. Every movement felt intentional and effective, leaving us feeling completely relaxed and refreshed.  Considering the high quality of service, the value for the price is fantastic. If you’re in Chiang Mai and looking for a genuinely rejuvenating spa experience, we highly recommend Daracha Spa. We’ll definitely be returning next time we’re in town!	Amazing massage!  60 min jet lag massage and I’ve never felt more refreshed!  The massage therapist was small but mighty!  She got out the kinks in my neck and the spams knots out of my legs and back.   10/10 recommend anyone visiting the area to come and get a massage here.  The facility is clean, smells great and is so pretty!  The massage therapist here are professional, and courteous.  Will get another massage or two before I leave the city!!!! 	Very good massage, calm atmosphere, kind people and the little offerings before and after the massage complete a beautiful experience! 	I had a very good foot massage, and my partner traditional Thai massage in the evening, busy place but only had to wait about 15 minutes for available staff. Hot tea before and after, friendly and welcoming with a pleasant atmosphere. Recommended. Will go again 👍🙏👍 … 	Counter staff very very friendly, but the massage service staff was very rude. They gave a check list the make sure which part you wanna stronger which part don’t touch. But the massage staff even didn’t see it seems. The environment was very clean that’s all. 	Worth every penny. We did the 1 hour foot scrub with foot and leg massage. They were very friendly and place was cool, so was nice to get out of the heat. Greeted with iced tea and upon completion, you get hot tea and snacks. I'm sure everything they offer would be just as good, so you can't go wrong. Highly recommend. 	The massage itself was great but it was all the other small things that really made the experience fantastic. Super attentive and kind. When my partner had a small coughing fit, they brought her something for her throat with warm tea. And at the end presented us with more tea and local cookies. Brilliant all round experience! 	Unfortunately I can only give 3 stars. The massage itself was very very good! Like the back, shoulder & feet massage. Like 5 stars! I was a bit disappointed by the head massage, it was quite boring and short. What I actually didn’t like were a few small points: the beginning was like a rush, I just saw my tea but there was zero time to drink it, the lady washed my feet super fast. I had to pay in advance, I never experienced that before. So it was difficult to calm down and relax at the beginning. Additionally it was very noisy. Not the lady who did the massage was talking, but the other staff and I had the feeling the door was open. So you can hear the traffic easily. If you don’t mind these little things I can recommend this place, but I wish for a more quiet and slow atmosphere. 	A nice experience in Dachara Spa. I had a tradtional Thai massage course this time and got totally relaxed after 90 minutes. I would like to recommend to those who wannna try Thai massage. Plus the snacks after the course was good. 	such an amazing first time experience. i believe i got a traditional thai massage which was amazing and i felt reborn after. i loved the stretching and yoga involved and when she cracked my back, WOW! overall the whole experience was extremely relaxing, we revived a jasmine foot soak and scrub before and had some sweet treats after. would recommend to anyone and will definitely be coming back before my trip is over!!! 	Fantastic Thai Massage! 1 hour session makes wonders with your body, total relaxation guaranteed! Space is so nicely decorated, staff is super friendly and kind, and most importantly - it’s very clean and fresh! Dimmed light and calm music. I wish I had come earlier to this place - try to book in advance as it can be fully occupied. 	Daracha Spa staff were amazing , they were attentive and knew all the sore spot . We felt light and refreshed after the 1 hr Thai massage , overall 10/10 experience!! 	It was my first massage experience in Asia and before I had a 10 hour bus trip I decided to take this massage because it looked very welcoming. What should I say? I never felt so good afterwards. Thank you so much for treating me so good. My neck, shoulder and back never felt so relieved. 	Great sevice from the start until the end. Nice and neat place, masseuses were top notch! Best experience 	BEST MASSAGE OF MY LIFE!!! I got the hour long Thai massage and it felt like time stopped completely. She literally got to every part of my body somehow in an hour and I need a lot of pressure and she absolutely delivered and I feel incredible! My boyfriend got the neck and shoulder and back massage and he also said his was incredible! After the massage they gave us the sweetest tea and treat setup and at 350 baht each plus tip it was such a good price for an amazing experience!! 10 out of 10 would recommend and we will be back again before we leave Chiang Mai!!! 	Had 3 massages there in 1 week. Great experience! Very kind people. Clean and professional. Appreciated as well the washing of the feet before the massage and the tea and cookie afterwards! 	Great experience! The environment was extremely relaxing and I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Chiang Mai. I recieved the "Foot, Back, and Shoulder" massage and it was lovely!  They started off with a quick cleanse of the feet in a flower petal bowl of water followed by some sort of sugar scrub.  My partner and I was then led upstairs to our respective rooms with curtains. The music was extremely calming and the employees were very kind. I never knew my back could pop as much as it did today!  🗒 Please note if you do not speak Thai, they do seem limited in English.
