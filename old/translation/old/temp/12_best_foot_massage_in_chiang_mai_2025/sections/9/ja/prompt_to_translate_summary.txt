One hour of pure pleasure, I'll come tomorrow. For information, foot massage with herbal beaulm one hour -> 450 B. And we could keep the baulm after, and we were offered a tea before leaving. Incredible 👌  Why again should I leave Thaïland ? 🤔 	First impressions: the parlor looks clean and serene and calm from the outside which is exactly the experience I wanted. I was looking for a zen massage place and this delivered. The service by the receptionist was lovely. There are refreshments served at the beginning and end of the experience. You first get your feet washed which is such a great beginning after all the walking. We got the body scrub and nourishment which would highly recommend. The ladies were sooo lovely to us and thorough. Honestly one of the best treatments I’ve had. Would come again. 	Very very comfortable and detailed 1 hr foot massage, I think it’s worth the price, booked the slot on klook, RM41.7 (around 314 thai baht), u can fully lay down on the sofa and take a good recharge during your chiang mai trip. 	We accidentally discovered this wonderful place, Relax Express. We tried the Traditional Thai Massage, and it was absolutely amazing! Both relaxing and invigorating at the same time—just what we needed. Complimentary tea was offered before the massage, and after, we enjoyed tea with snacks. The staff is very welcoming and professional. Highly recommend! 	I had a wonderful experience getting a foot massage at this place. The environment is super clean, calm, and relaxing, with soft music that creates the perfect atmosphere for unwinding.  The therapist was incredibly attentive, with impeccable technique that completely relieved the fatigue and tension in my feet. The pressure was applied perfectly, tailored to my needs, and I left feeling refreshed and light.  The customer service was excellent from the moment I arrived until the end of the session. I’ll definitely be coming back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and rejuvenating experience. Totally worth it! 	My favourite Thai massage spot - a little on the pricier side by the staff here are so kind and good at what they do. They helped discover and treat problem areas on my body and give extra attention to those areas. They really listen to your needs. I’ll recommend them every time. Tea and snack is great touch too! 	Amazing experience very calming and relaxing from the moment you walk in. Very quiet and only a little calming music. Complimentary drinks before and after service. The whole venue is clean and well laid out. Everyone is lovely and professional. The body scrub was amazing could not recommend it enough! 100% would come here again 	It’s just wonderful!!! Every time after Thai traditional massage i’m feeling like just borne again. Recommend minimum 3 or 5 times did it restart for your body)) 	The masseuse danced along my spine not touching my spine once. I had a Thai oil massage and was made very relaxed, true to their name.  Would definitely recommend a visit ☺️ 	What an experience ! Perfect massage in old part of Chiang Mai. Staff is super polite. 	It was really relaxing and comfortable. The atmosphere was calm and i’ve received a great massage. Body felt much better after the massage. Wish i knew here sooner during the trip! 	Nice welcome, friendly staff and massage is according to your wishes. Family friendly and ending with an aromatic cup of tea. For sure a place to come back to! 	Great staff, receptionist speaks English very well. Nice atmosphere and prices. Overall highly recommend. 	The experience at Relax Express was amazing. The staff was pleasant and dedicated. We had a 60-minute foot massage, which started with a foot wash and scrub, continued with compressions and other things while they made sure we were as comfortable as possible. The atmosphere is relaxing and amazing. We were also treated to a short head and neck massage. At the end, we were served tea and a rice cake on beautiful dishes. The overall experience was amazing, we left feeling like new. 	I had a great pleasure from the massage yesterday!  I felt cosy and cared for while there, and after a traditional Thai massage, I fell asleep sweetly as a baby.  I'll be back again today 😀 	Great foot massage! The therapists are true professionals — they know exactly what they're doing. I felt relaxed and refreshed after the session. Highly recommend if you're in Chiang Mai and looking for quality massage service. 	EXCELLENT MASSAGE ! NO.1 in Chiang mai😍😍😍Thank you so much for good service ! …
