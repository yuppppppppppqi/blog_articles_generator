I had the most disappointing experience at this massage center. The receptionist was unfriendly, which set a bad tone from the start. Despite clear instructions to maintain silence and keep phones on silent mode for a relaxing environment, the staff kept chatting loudly, their phones were constantly ringing, and a buzzing machine kept going off, making it impossible to relax.  The foot spa and pedicure were equally disappointing—the water was not warm enough, and the service was below average. I also had serious concerns about hygiene. While they claimed the manicure and pedicure tools were sanitized, I saw my pedicure tools being put back into the toolbox without proper cleaning, which made me doubtful about their hygiene standards.  Overall, a terrible experience.	Was delighted to find a massage parlor within walking distance from my accommodations. Unfortunately, the only positive thing about Lek Massage is the location; easy to spot and near to BTS (National Stadium). I went for a foot massage (SGD 18) and the staff there was not skillful at all. The whole session was very uncomfortable and ticklish. I would never patronize again.	Don't believe the good reviews. I went for an one hour massage $650. All I got was a towel on my back with techniques of push , elbow and squeeze massage. After 20 I had to leave.  Pillow had a bad smell and the towel gave me a bad itch. They still charged me $550. Don't go there. 	Went to Lek massage house twice during my 4D3N stay as it was conveniently located next to our hotel at National Stadium BTS. The booking via the Lek massage app was easy and straightforward, it also allows you to check for available time slots which makes planning easier. As first-time app users, we were offered 50baht off as welcome voucher.  Services that I tried: Thai massage + aroma oil massage (120mins) Foot massage + shoulder and back (90mins)  Recommended therapists: Imm, Pla & Pat.  The receptionist at the counter was so-so okay. Payment to be made before the service and both days we were on time and waited <15mins for the masseuses to arrive (no biggie). I’m a massage lover who appreciates a bit of aching and pain during the process. And the masseuses’ strokes were firm and consistent throughout the session.  My body felt totally refreshed and ache-free again from all the walking and shopping. Thank you. 	I went for a foot massage twice with my family, the first time the foot massage was okay. The second time I was truly disappointed. Firstly the receptionist at the counter doesn't even care to explain about the services. No politeness at all. She is only ready to show the amount on the calculator, payment first and then the services. 450 Bhat for 60 minutes foot massage no worth at all. The massage therapist does a massage as if she is doing us a favour. They speak to each other and body shame the customers. I could easily understand their behaviour. No empathy at all. All the staff at this branch needs to learn communication skills asap. Than you. P.S: highly recommend Sukhumvit 11 lane foot massage. They do the foot massage diligently and worthwhile the charges. Just at the start of soi 11. Thnk you.	Place is very cramp and small. Guests are seated close to one another or in open area where human traffic r heavy with no privacy. Depending on where u r seated, u r either too cold or too warm fr the lack of aircon. Some of the masseuse talk too loudly among themselves n r not as good as the ones in Lek other outlets. Overall a lackluster experience. Will not be back. 	Made an appointment prior and staff ensured that staff were present to start massage. Massage was relaxing and good. 	One of the many branches of Lek Massage chain of stores. Lek massage has many different massages to choose from. Recommended. 	Nice and clean place close to my hotel. Friendly staff. 	We went into this shop to get a massage and they accommodated both of us and our requests. They were nice and professional.  I took a Thai massage and the masseuse destroyed me ( in a positive way ). They respected the full hour and gave me water and cookies on my way out.  Thanks Lek team! 	Booked 1 hour foot massage for 6 pax and all of us are disappointed. The masseurs don’t seems interested to put in any effort for proper job, very unlike other Lek outlets. Will not revisit this shop ! Never ever 	Therapist was very powerful and skilled.  Completely rejuvenated after Thai massage with herbal compress.  Thank you Orm 	The service is good. The staff are lovely and give very good advice. I like the aroma oil massage. 	This is my third massage here and always love it. Great price and quality, fully recommend 	Relaxing and calm environment. Good and relaxing. Very friendly staff. Well recommended. 	I never have good massage from this branch at all…its near my house and i wanna give them a chance…but every time i was there…it end up with bad experience.. 	Not a good traditional Thai massage. There are many better places in the area	Robotic, repetitive and half hearted. You will get that limited sequence throughout the entire session no matter the duration you choose. If you really had to visit, choose the shortest duration. 	I went to this massage parlour as it was near my hotel and it was raining. I enjoyed the 30 minutes leg massage. The masseuse was skilled and I enjoyed the massage. Staff were friendly and polite, reflecting the Thai culture. 	Not too bad but not quite value for your money. You can get a better massage from a small place a side street for B200 less. Nice shop and interior though...
