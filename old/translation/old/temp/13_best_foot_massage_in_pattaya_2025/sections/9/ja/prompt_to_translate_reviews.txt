We both had a 2hr massage for 400 TB each. 1hr Thai massage (with nice clothing that they provide) followed by a 1hr oil massage. I’ve had a lot of deep tissue treatments but my massage from Sao (or Soa) was outstanding. She is a slender lady with grey hair and is very agile and strong. She never gave up on the tightness of my neck and shoulders and relieved most of my tightness. Outstanding massage! Also, I didn’t believe the prices they advertise but incredible value at Poo Na. Well worth the short walk from the beach area. 	I love this shop. Nong has become one of my favorite therapists.  I just ask for what i want to be focused on, and she'll adjust according to my needs. Will definitely be back. 150 for foot or thai massage.  250 for oil which is similar to Swedish. They do massage your stomach and chest. If not comfortable with that just mention ahead of time and they'll skip it. 	I recently visited Poo Na Health Massage with two friends, and we had an outstanding experience. We opted for a combination of foot massage, head and shoulders massage, and a body scrub, all for a fantastic rate over two hours.  From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was welcoming. The receptionist was friendly and took the time to explain our options, ultimately crafting a custom experience just for us. The masseuse who worked on me was incredibly attentive, focusing on my specific pain points and adjusting pressure as needed. I was impressed that she didn’t expect an additional tip, which speaks to her professionalism and dedication to providing great service—though she certainly deserved one!  The entire session lasted about 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I appreciated the engaging and professional approach of the staff throughout. I left feeling rejuvenated and satisfied with the service. I highly recommend Poo Na Health Massage for anyone seeking an authentic Thai massage experience. I look forward to my next visit! 	Fell in love the first time, Got a Thai massage and had to go back the next day for more! Good pricing and good service, the ladies were welcoming and friendly as well. The place was cozy and left feeling very relaxed. Recommend the Aroma Massage!! 	The Poo Na Health team are seriously the best. I’ve tried both their Thai and foot massages, and both are top-notch. The therapists know exactly how much pressure to apply, and they always leave me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. Plus, the place has a really chill vibe. If you’re in the area, definitely check them out. 	Came here during my first visit to thailand back in 2022, and now again in 2024. It's really worth the money and super professional.  I had shoulder pain and they applied pain relief oil as well. Would definitely come here again in my next visit! 	Be careful, SCAM!!! I order Head and Shoulder, is more expensive, and they give me normal massage like thai massage which is more cheap. Also i book 1 our, but get only 50 minutes. After massage I claim but anyway they took full money! And after she touched my feed (she did not clean my feet as well), she did not wash her hands, and touched directly my head…this is a no go in Thailand. 	Found this massage parlour based on other reviews. Can't beat the pricing. Ladies are experienced but as some have said, they like to chit chat either with customers or among themselves. Can't fault them cause this is not those fancy spa places either. Still quite a clean place and will get a drink at the end of it. Generally quite a good massage experience. Lady boss friendly as well. 	I tried different locations but this one turned out to be the best I had in Pattaya. We were the group of 4 - the entire family - and all of us absolutely loved it 	Excellent massage with inexpensive price. The masseuses are aged ladies who have professional skill and friendly mind. This shop is small and equipment are worn but I could get great satisfaction from the nice massage they gave me. I'd visit this massage shop everyday when I was staying in Pattaya. I miss them a lot and want to go Pattaya again to get their fantastic massage. Thank you for every staff in this shop as well as Kit and Nut.	price had risen at 150 the/1 hour Prefer book on line app 	Natalie was amazing! Came two days in a row! No funny business here, great massage quality and was able to customize for my needs. Small shop, everyone is friendly and personable. 	The service is amazing (thai and oil massage), sri really knows what she’s doing and focus on the areas which it hurts the most,, I stayed in Pattaya for 3 days and went to poo na everyday. Highly recommended. 	Amazing! I had so much pain and tightness to my back, hips and legs. The lady knew exactly how and where to apply pressure. I left with an increased range of motion and relaxed. I think I paid 150b for an hour. No tip was asked, but she definitely deserved it. I highly recommend! 	It’s a great place to take experience of traditional Thai massage. We took body scrub and it was great. 	Best massage place in Pattaya. Everyone in Poo na is really friendly and treated me so well. Loved it 	Gave me the roughest thai massage ever, this lady did not know how to give a Thai massage came out there aching and pain
