Never tried head so I went for that one.  I would say 3 things to take note of next time -  1. Don't come in too late to closing hours. Recommend to arrive earlier so u can opt for longer hours of treatment so don't be like me.  2. Do not recommend 30 mins head massage. They use a tool most of the time to massage rather than their skills. So I don't feel much of it  3. Coming in too late the therapist will fall asleep. When she was massaging the head while sitting down, can feel that she's tired and falling asleep soon. Haha 	🤩 I had a wonderful experience. The spa is clean, well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and attentive. They have a snacks and free drinking water. I would highly recommend this spa to anyone looking for a place to relax and rejuvenate in Bangkok. … 	I cannot fault this place. And it was a nice haven to decompress  Tried to come here one night and it was full, so I booked ahead for a Saturday night. I showed up late and they were happy without complaint.  The ambience and decor is just lovely and calming, everything very new and clean. Below the face hole there was a nice arrangement of flowers for me to look at.  Presentation or tea & cookies was a nice touch.  100% would come back again 	This place was lovely and exactly what we needed during our 5 hour layover. It’s walking distance from the airport or a short Grab ride away. The staff were courteous and the masseuse super strong. 	RACIST. AND False advertising on the closing hours. LITERALLY saw them invite 2 middle easterns for a massage before I webt in. I'm asia . They said, they close already--6 hours before advertised closing 	the receptionist was very sweet and friendly when we called up asking for general information. We were greeted nicely by such welcoming gestures and vibes, also those smiling faces from all staff once we arrived at the place. The therapist, Khun Ann, was really polite and talented, always checking if the pressure was well enough.  I highly recommend “Ploenchiva Massage” if you are in nearby area looking for one good place for massages, and I will definitely come back if I have a chance visiting this area :)	Beautiful and clean place but it was unfortunately the worst foot massage I ever had! I found this place on my way back from dinner and because of the interior I was totally keen on it. I went for an hour foot massage. The woman at the reception was really nice and after 5 min the massage lady came. As anywhere the properly cleaned my feet and then get started. The first 20 minutes she massaged my left foot and lower leg and then she went on to my right foot and lower leg - that for the rest of the 40 minutes! Besides she did totally different things on the right side. I asked her if she will go back to the left side and do the same thing on both side but she didn’t react. So exactly after 1h she stopped and left. I immediately told the woman at the reception what happened and that I wasn’t satisfied with the massage. She told me to wait and she will see for another woman. While waiting I got tea and a biscuit. I was sitting right next to the reception so I was able to observe that she basically didn’t do anything. After 15-20min of waiting I went back to her and she just told me she cannot do anything and I should pay now. I had many massage throughout Thailand, also bad ones but this was really the worst and the employee’s attitude was inappropriate and unfriendly at the end. I have read all the good reviews here and maybe I was just unlucky that day, but I cannot recommend this massage place at all. Even the good prices and the beautiful interior doesn't help. If I could I would even give 0 stars! 	Deep tissue massage worse than oil massage. No pressure at all. Above normal price but massage very unprofessional 	One of the best foot massage I’ve ever had in Thailand. Everything is super clean, new and luxurious, the therapists are fantastic and well trained.  I felt extremely relaxed and comfortable.  After the massage we got a complementary tea and cookies… my boyfriend and I couldn’t ask for more.  Highly recommend!	Nice and clean facility. Very professional staffs and pay attention in little details. Great experience. Highly recommended 💆🏽‍♀️👍🏽 … 	Very professional massage. We took 1 hr foot massage and both our massage therapists were friendly and with good, strong hands. Complimentary hot tea and buscuits after massage. 	Clean and professional spa, excellent service from staff and therapists ✨👍 … 	Beautiful place decorated with taste! And sparkling clean ✨ The massage was excellent, the staff so warm, welcoming and polite, If you are in the area don't hesitate, I would definitely come back myself! ❤️❤️ 	One of the best massages I’ve ever had. And I had many. Calm atmosphere, very friendly staff, clean shop, good service. Perfect 👌🏻 … 	I had an amazing foot and head massage, it was so complete and well done. The staff is very nice, kind and attentive. The spa is clean and I recommend it if you are close to the airport.	So comfortable!!! Service here is so so so nice!! I will come again!!Thanks for your hard work Love from China!Bye Thailand🥺 … 	Great massage , totally recommend. This is the place to be .
