I really like the menu. There are many new things. And what I like most is the standard. No matter who you massage with, it's the same. Mildly fragrant massage oil The scent is aromatic. There are 3 scents to choose from. I like every scent. It's real Essential Oil. After massaging, I feel light. I feel comfortable doing facials. My skin is so clear that my friends ask me what I did. Most importantly, the skin is strong and doesn't burn as easily as before. I give it 5 stars. 	Have been a regular customer here for many years. All the masseuses are good. The shop is beautiful and clean. The music plays very well. I really like the herbal compress massage. Fresh herbal aromatic compress After the massage I felt very relaxed. Came for a massage with my daughter. That person likes to exfoliate the skin and get a Gluta massage. Now the skin is really whiter and smoother. I really like it. It's my favorite spa shop. 	Clean, the staff are very nice. After using the service, your face is comfortable and your body is comfortable. At the end, ginger juice, bael fruit juice, etc. are served, which can also be refreshing. 	I have been a customer for 6 years. I really like the body and foot massage here. Impressed with the service And the massage skills of the staff are excellent. So I have become a regular customer until today. 	I've been a customer here since the store opened. In total, it's been almost 15 years. I like and am impressed with the service and massage skills of the staff..Personally, I like aromatherapy massage because it's really relaxing..and I like foot massage too because I've tried many massages and I like this place the most. Because the massage is really different from other shops. It's a pressure point massage and also has herbal compresses..so it's a shop that I choose to do regularly all the time. It's been 15 years already...👍👍👍 	Have been a customer here for more than 15 years, from the time the store opened until now.

Every time I come, I feel really relaxed and relieved of my aches and pains.. I like it the most.. 	In the past, I used to do physical therapy at the hospital due to office syndrome. Then I tried getting a massage here, which is a package especially for office people. I was impressed because the massage here was unlike anywhere else. Very comfortable, like feeling really relaxed. Came to try it for the first time and my shoulder pain disappeared. Shoulders like when getting a massage at a hospital, so you can tell how hard it is. The place is clean, the staff are good and friendly, the workmanship is good. 	I am a very regular customer here. It's been 15 years..usually working in other provinces. But if you come to Bangkok and want to do a spa..you will think of this restaurant as the first place..because there are many menus to choose from to do a complete service..the staff are lovely and provide every level of service..impressive..I like it the most..😊😊😊 	A friend recommended it and had never done a spa before. and never knew about spas Today I want to make a face.

Like every service The staff take excellent care and attention. Suitable for being a regular customer for 14 years. 	Tried the service and really liked it. There are many different types of menus to choose from, including facial massages, body massages, and complete foot massages. I have been a customer for a long time and have opened packages for the entire spa group. and group therapy Every level of service is impressive. Really excellent. 	I read other people's reviews that it was good, so I gave it a try because it's close to my house and in the mall where I often shop. When I arrived it was really good. The receptionist is cute and not busy. Let us choose slowly and see what we want 😊 Spa massage is comfortable and meets our needs very much.😊 Anyone who likes spa massage, try it. I recommend this place.👍 	Have been massaging here since 2011. I like to relax and massage my feet, neck, and shoulders. I really like the massage here. It's clean. Massage and relax, no pain. I like it very much. In addition, all the staff are very friendly and greeting you very well. 	Clean place, polite staff, very good at massaging. Relaxing body massage improves blood circulation. The foot acupressure massage was very good and there was a compress as well. 	Whenever I get tired, I think of Belessa, but you have to call and make a reservation in advance because there are a lot of customers here. I normally come here for a massage and like to scrub my skin and get oil massages. The staff here give very good massages, the atmosphere is good, the place is clean, there are a lot of treatments to choose from. 	Today I came to get a facial. This facial massage place is very good, both using hands and machines, depending on what you like. But personally, I prefer massaging my face with my hands. It's very comfortable. This place emphasizes on nourishment.
