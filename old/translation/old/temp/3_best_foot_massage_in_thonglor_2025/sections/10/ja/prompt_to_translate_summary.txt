Masseuses professional and great skills! Friendly and clean spa! I been back many times when visit Bkk . 	Great massage place ! Very kind staff and clean place. The message I got really helped with my shoulders and back which was hurting for quite a while. Very thankful.  I will def visit them again when in town.	Requested for 90 mins. Only got 80mins with no technique, just rubbing Staff requested for tips (??) Shouldn’t tips be given willingly by customers? Loud noise from the roads. Masseuse couldn’t wait to finish their job. They wash customer’s legs in front of other resting customers. Quite annoying  Anyway won’t recommend.	After seeing all the negatives comments here I wanted to add mine as I had a great experience ✨ Had to explain a little how I wanted my foot massage, back/shoulder was very good. Staff is nice. 	I know.  It depends on the person doing the massage.  My massage therapist today was not very good.  She  just  rubbed. 	Very nice place for massage and the service is very good Hi recommend for this shop.👍🏻👍🏻 … 	The Tap session ruined the experience. I hope it can just add the tip fee to the menu, not asking 100 baht for a tip after a massage.  And the craziest thing is after I gave 40 baht as a tip, not 100 baht, the manager looked so unpleasant and annoyed, I don’t mind offering more for the tip but at least train the skill better first!  It’s gross	Had a visit recently after tiresome work, Had Oil massage by masseur name “Pad Thai” Very friendly and considerate as I told her my calve hurt just before the massage. She remembered and always go softly around the area. The oil is very aromatic and soothing my nerves. She did thoroughly especially my back presuming I visited with my office attire , helping my office syndromes.  I would recommend for everyone, but in my case as a local, the price is alittle higher than other shop in the same areas.	Nice and clean, very professional staff 	Amazing quality of massages. Very hospitable manager and happy staff. Been back twice and both experiences were world class. 	If you are looking for a leg rub instead of foot massage, this is the place. Went to about 20 massage places over the years in Bangkok, easily the worst foot massage I’ve got. No technique, no strength. The masseuse never even touched bottom of my feet, pure leg menthol lotion rub. Waste of my money and time. 	I went there for a 90mins aromatherapy in the afternoon. Did not need booking in advance. Friendly staff but the place under renovation with noise.  The musseur isn’t very focused when she did the massage. They talk with each other and I didn’t see any skills from her massage, only rubbing my body with oil.  Disappointed experience	Honestly, one of the worse massages I have had in Thailand! Masseuse talking extremely loud, coupled with a poor massage. I couldn’t wait till it was over. Literally went for a proper massage straight after. Do not recommend but nuch massage is the best! Will never return! 	Convenient massage shop near where we live. Clean and friendly. Very satisfying! 	Great foot massage, good value and friendly 	Very good massage. Nice place. Nice people 	One of the worst massages I’ve had in Thailand. Very disappointing. My therapist basically just rubbed without much technique and skill. 	I got massage everyday when I visit Bangkok, sometimes even twice a day. This place cheating time for sure! I pay an hour, and the lady only did 50 mins (I clock the time). I tell the lady that she should do 10 more mins till an hour. But she just be laughing, and did 3 more mins only. It’s my first time visiting a “DISHONEST”massage store. Shame one you. So I didn’t tip her.	The skill wasn't good like it was just rubbing you with their elbow, we booked for an hour and it was only 50 mins included the time that they asked us to take two showers. The worse thing is they asked you to tip them when you’re naked and refused to settle it later after you put your clothes back. 	Ok, so went here based on a few reviews with my gf. I opted for the oil massage and gf just a foot massage. I was taken to the top floor where there was a shower and two beds. Now when you see a shower you think something is different as to the service. The girl was sweet and strong. When I received no shorts and was basically naked, I felt well this is strange.  Half way through the massage she was getting really close and finally asked me if I wanted a massage down there 🦴 I politely declined. I would go again because the girl gave a good massage, but not expecting that from a massage place in this area. 🤣
