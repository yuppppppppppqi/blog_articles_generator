The space is spacious, not crowded or noisy, which adds to the peaceful ambiance. The massage therapist was excellent — attentive to every detail, including the desired pressure level, and made the whole experience deeply relaxing and soothing. The massage bed also had a built-in heating system, which kept me warm and cozy even with the air conditioning on. I felt completely at ease and even dozed off during the session. A truly restful experience! 	Very mild and relaxing foot massage, with nice drinks and snacks. Just in the same building as hotel nikko, very convenience for hotel member. The store has great environment and very less crowded. The service is nice everyone comes with smile.  purchased item: 600 for 45mins foot massage. 	Went for a package with my partner. Nice ambience and service. They collected our preference on the focus area for our massage on the tablet. However during the massage, believed our masseuses mixed up our preference and i got different focus area instead of what i indicated. That apart, the massage was still great! Will definitely go back the next time im in bangkok 	Today, I had the pleasure of using the services here and was truly impressed. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming, and the place was clean and comfortable. I felt at ease throughout my visit. I will definitely return again in the future. 	I am very appreciative of the patience and care of the therapist I had. She was extremely professional and provided everything I wanted. I encourage others to visit! 	I had the 90 minute Dream Package here. The masseuse was very skilled and applied the right amount of pressure. I even fell asleep at some point during the massage. The place is deceptively big once you enter after the entrance, is very clean and smells are very soothing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing time to try this place out. 	I am a long term regular customer for a long long term and very happy to see Let’s Relax to progress till today stage, contributors definitely a very good massage and service I received today. 	Let’s Relax Onsen & Spa Thonglor, located on the 5th floor of the Grande Centre Point Hotel, provides a serene spa experience that includes access to various onsen baths, saunas, and steam rooms. A notable highlight for guests is the complimentary mango sticky rice served after their spa treatments, which adds a delightful Thai touch to the relaxation experience ￼ ￼. 	Very good massage, luxurious feel and high level of comfort. Staffs are very nice too. Highly recommend! 	I went for the back, neck and shoulder massage in the special massage chair. I was expecting a strong and powerful massage to my neck and shoulders as I have experienced before and which is the point of this chair. This was however, a very weak massage, only using hands and fingers, no elbows or any power and the chair was not adjusted properly to my body so it hurt my neck even though I asked for it to be adjusted.  Other places locally do a much better massage for the neck and shoulders despite not having the specific chair, they are also half of the price. I would say not worth it at all I feel absolutely no relief whatsoever. I feel even worse than when I came in. 	The technician is so skilled. And the environment is quite clean and comfortable. The service is also very sweet. 	We went here a couple of times. The male masseuses did a good job, but the female masseuses are not worth the high price.  The receptionists were not good, they ask you to pay first, then tell you that something you requested is not available. 	My 2nd time to Lets relax but first time to this outlet. Great ambience  n service. Therapist was good and the massage was good too. Will definitely recommend! 	Went for a back and shoulder massage absolutely loveddd it. So so relaxing, the staff was very kind and friendly. Would definitely recommend ♥️ 	The massage was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience with my massage therapist as well as the environment among the place and the staff 	I always visit Let’s Relax. The environment is great, clean, comfortable, and overall an amazing experience. 	The atmosphere here is quite quiet. All the staff are very cute and easy to travel near the BTS sky train.	It was the BEST massage i have ever had. And I am a frequent massager🙈  I ordered a "dream package" which include foot hand and head and shoulder massage. Michit my therapist had done a good job. The strengthness is just right to the point. I definitely feel relaxed after he stretching my neck.  I will definitely find Michit on my every visit to Bangkok❤️	First of all, good location. Just a few minutes walk from Thong Lo BTS station. The place was clean and peaceful. The masseur was skilful, strong and professional. I had a really good Thai massage here. It was 90 minutes and I wish I had taken a longer one. The complimentary sticky mango rice was also very good! Oh, book your slot a day in advance if you don’t want to be disappointed at the counter. 	Very comfortable and relax, definitely will come back again
