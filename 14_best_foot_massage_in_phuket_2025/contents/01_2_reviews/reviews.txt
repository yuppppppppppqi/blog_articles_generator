Therapist knew exactly where my frozen shoulder needed <strong><u>relief</u></strong>. Pain-free for hours!
My back hernia finally got the <strong><u>expert treatment</u></strong> it needed. Will return weekly.
Two hours of Thai-foot combo left me in <strong><u>absolute bliss</u></strong>. Worth every baht!
Their <strong><u>herbal gel</u></strong> worked wonders on my tense muscles. So relaxing!
Tea and biscuits after my <strong><u>perfect massage</u></strong> was a lovely touch.
The <strong><u>private room</u></strong> made my aromatherapy session so peaceful and calming.
Loved how they <strong><u>customized pressure</u></strong> for my sore neck. Incredible difference!
Clean space and <strong><u>professional service</u></strong> at reasonable prices. Highly recommend!
My therapist seemed distracted and rushed. Still a good massage overall.
Inconsistent experience - amazing first time, mediocre with different therapist second visit.
