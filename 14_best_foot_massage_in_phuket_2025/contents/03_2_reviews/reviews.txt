The older masseuse fixed my frozen shoulder with <strong><u>miraculous balms</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Authentic Thai techniques</u></strong> here are better than fancy spa massages elsewhere.
Simple place, but <strong><u>extraordinary healing skills</u></strong>. My back pain disappeared!
<strong><u>Jira's attention to detail</u></strong> during my foot massage was exceptional.
This place offers <strong><u>genuine therapeutic relief</u></strong> rather than tourist fluff.
The warming and cooling treatments gave me <strong><u>incredible comfort</u></strong>.
No fancy decor, just <strong><u>powerful, effective massage</u></strong> by skilled hands.
<strong><u>Clean, welcoming atmosphere</u></strong> where both locals and tourists feel at home.
Communication was difficult. Had to keep showing where it hurt.
The masseur applied too much pressure despite my requests for gentler technique.
