The hot onsen perfectly <strong><u>prepared my muscles</u></strong> for the amazing massage after.
Their <strong><u>immaculate facility</u></strong> and beautiful d√©cor transported me to Japan.
Therapist let me choose my <strong><u>preferred aromatherapy scent</u></strong>. Such personalization!
Left feeling like a <strong><u>completely new person</u></strong>. Truly transformative experience.
The <strong><u>staff's hospitality</u></strong> made this hidden gem even more special.
Perfect couple's experience with <strong><u>exceptional attention</u></strong> to every detail.
Their <strong><u>professional service</u></strong> is worth every baht of the reasonable price.
The <strong><u>herbal tea</u></strong> after my deep tissue massage completed the perfect experience.
Struggled to stay in the onsen for full hour. Too hot for beginners.
Strange location next to a petrol station. Hard to find without GPS.
