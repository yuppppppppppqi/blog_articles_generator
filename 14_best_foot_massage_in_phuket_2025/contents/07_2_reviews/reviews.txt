<strong><u>Nikki's powerful technique</u></strong> released muscle knots I've had for months!
Mon gives massages with such <strong><u>loving care</u></strong>, like a mother's touch.
The <strong><u>sincere attention</u></strong> made my experience feel genuinely personal.
Their <strong><u>strong Thai massage</u></strong> fixed my shoulder pain better than physiotherapy.
Love the <strong><u>clean, welcoming atmosphere</u></strong> with soothing music and cool air.
Nancy's <strong><u>professional expertise</u></strong> made me feel like I was in paradise.
Only place open late - <strong><u>authentic treatment</u></strong> with no tourist shortcuts.
Their <strong><u>herbal hot compress</u></strong> was incredible. Worth the 800 baht!
Requested female therapist but got male/trans masseuse. Respect customers' preferences.
Massage was uneven and lacked rhythm. Therapist seemed untrained.
