<strong><u>Tukta's incredible technique</u></strong> released all the tension in my back. Feel amazing!
Sugar gave me the <strong><u>most thorough foot massage</u></strong> I've ever experienced.
They constantly checked if the <strong><u>pressure was comfortable</u></strong>. So attentive!
Ended up extending my massage because the <strong><u>experience was heavenly</u></strong>.
The <strong><u>calm atmosphere</u></strong> provides perfect escape from Patong's busy streets.
Pu's <strong><u>detailed attention</u></strong> to every knot made a world of difference.
Deep tissue massage here has <strong><u>remarkable therapeutic value</u></strong>. Worth every baht!
<strong><u>Clean, professional environment</u></strong> with genuinely friendly staff. Will return!
Therapist just rubbed aloe gel without any technique. Very disappointing.
Asked for medium pressure but received painfully strong massage instead.
