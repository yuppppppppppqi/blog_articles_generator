Never tried head so I went for that one.  I would say 3 things to take note of next time -  1. Don't come in too late to closing hours. Recommend to arrive earlier so u can opt for longer hours of treatment so don't be like me.  2. Do not recommend 30 mins head massage. They use a tool most of the time to massage rather than their skills. So I don't feel much of it  3. Coming in too late the therapist will fall asleep. When she was massaging the head while sitting down, can feel that she's tired and falling asleep soon. Haha 	ü§© I had a wonderful experience. The spa is clean, well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and attentive. They have a snacks and free drinking water. I would highly recommend this spa to anyone looking for a place to relax and rejuvenate in Bangkok. ‚Ä¶ 	I cannot fault this place. And it was a nice haven to decompress  Tried to come here one night and it was full, so I booked ahead for a Saturday night. I showed up late and they were happy without complaint.  The ambience and decor is just lovely and calming, everything very new and clean. Below the face hole there was a nice arrangement of flowers for me to look at.  Presentation or tea & cookies was a nice touch.  100% would come back again 	This place was lovely and exactly what we needed during our 5 hour layover. It‚Äôs walking distance from the airport or a short Grab ride away. The staff were courteous and the masseuse super strong. 	RACIST. AND False advertising on the closing hours. LITERALLY saw them invite 2 middle easterns for a massage before I webt in. I'm asia . They said, they close already--6 hours before advertised closing 	the receptionist was very sweet and friendly when we called up asking for general information. We were greeted nicely by such welcoming gestures and vibes, also those smiling faces from all staff once we arrived at the place. The therapist, Khun Ann, was really polite and talented, always checking if the pressure was well enough.  I highly recommend ‚ÄúPloenchiva Massage‚Äù if you are in nearby area looking for one good place for massages, and I will definitely come back if I have a chance visiting this area :)	Beautiful and clean place but it was unfortunately the worst foot massage I ever had! I found this place on my way back from dinner and because of the interior I was totally keen on it. I went for an hour foot massage. The woman at the reception was really nice and after 5 min the massage lady came. As anywhere the properly cleaned my feet and then get started. The first 20 minutes she massaged my left foot and lower leg and then she went on to my right foot and lower leg - that for the rest of the 40 minutes! Besides she did totally different things on the right side. I asked her if she will go back to the left side and do the same thing on both side but she didn‚Äôt react. So exactly after 1h she stopped and left. I immediately told the woman at the reception what happened and that I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the massage. She told me to wait and she will see for another woman. While waiting I got tea and a biscuit. I was sitting right next to the reception so I was able to observe that she basically didn‚Äôt do anything. After 15-20min of waiting I went back to her and she just told me she cannot do anything and I should pay now. I had many massage throughout Thailand, also bad ones but this was really the worst and the employee‚Äôs attitude was inappropriate and unfriendly at the end. I have read all the good reviews here and maybe I was just unlucky that day, but I cannot recommend this massage place at all. Even the good prices and the beautiful interior doesn't help. If I could I would even give 0 stars! 	Deep tissue massage worse than oil massage. No pressure at all. Above normal price but massage very unprofessional 	One of the best foot massage I‚Äôve ever had in Thailand. Everything is super clean, new and luxurious, the therapists are fantastic and well trained.  I felt extremely relaxed and comfortable.  After the massage we got a complementary tea and cookies‚Ä¶ my boyfriend and I couldn‚Äôt ask for more.  Highly recommend!	Nice and clean facility. Very professional staffs and pay attention in little details. Great experience. Highly recommended üíÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëçüèΩ ‚Ä¶ 	Very professional massage. We took 1 hr foot massage and both our massage therapists were friendly and with good, strong hands. Complimentary hot tea and buscuits after massage. 	Clean and professional spa, excellent service from staff and therapists ‚ú®üëç ‚Ä¶ 	Beautiful place decorated with taste! And sparkling clean ‚ú® The massage was excellent, the staff so warm, welcoming and polite, If you are in the area don't hesitate, I would definitely come back myself! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 	One of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had. And I had many. Calm atmosphere, very friendly staff, clean shop, good service. Perfect üëåüèª ‚Ä¶ 	I had an amazing foot and head massage, it was so complete and well done. The staff is very nice, kind and attentive. The spa is clean and I recommend it if you are close to the airport.	So comfortable!!! Service here is so so so nice!! I will come again!!Thanks for your hard work Love from China!Bye Thailandü•∫ ‚Ä¶ 	Great massage , totally recommend. This is the place to be .

I was given a private room with shower and the experience was perfect. Room was clean, therapist was experienced and price was reasonable. Will definitely come again. 	Feeling fresh and relax  like I‚Äôm in Japan. Nice and clean. Friendly staff. Reasonable price.  There are 3 types of Onsen experience., to day ai selected Noboribetsu Karurusu (Hokkaido) 	We booked both Onsen and Aroma massage package. They welcomed us with cups of tea and let us choose the Aroma scent and the colors of Onsen water.  The staffs here are friendly and helpful. I would definitely come again. 	Not sure how they have received such good reviews. My wife who is Thai and a massage therapist in Australia for the last 13 years in her own business just had a foot massage. As you can imagine I have had plenty of massages and my wife knows what she is doing. My massage was ok but my wife‚Äôs was awful and she Will praise if it deserves it. The massage felt like we were sitting on the main road which the shop is right next too. As a builder there would be ways to minimise the amount of noise but certainly not something they have worried about. Staff were reasonably friendly but I think pretty tired. Place was clean and welcoming towels and drink was nice. Overall for the money very disappointing. We would have come back tomorrow for additional massage of some type but will give it a big miss and try somewhere else. 	This shop is all you need for relaxation. It offers both massage and onsen in a very nice environment. Very good service and reasonable price ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ 	The place is very peaceful and comfortable, suitable for the messy day. Should reserve for the onsen before coming. 	Best private Onsen so far in Bangkok with reasonable price and cozy vibe ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	Nice service, Nice environment. Should go try once!! 	Very relax and reasonable price 	This place is amazing and comfortable for everyone. If you like easygoing,you could try to go here. 	Very nice relaxing environment. 	It's the best place. They have the best service. Super clean, friendly staff. Super helpful. Mind and body relax very well. 	Great experience very beautiful and great massage 	A cool place to get relaxed physically and mentally.The staffs are nice,well-trained and the service is satisfying enough.There is also a little cafe shop in front,the drinks are must-try!! Highly recommend for those who want a chilling day at Massage shop. 	While waiting for my queue at immigration, I had the idea to come get a foot massage and spend some time at a local Onsen! It was absolutely bliss! ü§© ‚Ä¶ 	If you're looking for decent, clean, relaxing, and reasonable price massage, this place is highly recommended.  The staff can speak English, and the masseuses are experts . They also have complimentary tea that you can enjoy after the massage. 	It is absolutely a place to go. Perfect vibe and environment. Transports you to a relaxing zone immediately entering the premise.  The session for me is perfect with a lot of care and attentiveness. Is perfect for travellers entering Bangkok through Don Mueng Airport.  Catch a massage immediately arriving Bangkok gets u ready for the city and end the trip with a relaxing massage and revive you after the trip. Bring back the love and care from bangkok to your home.  Perfect

I really like the menu. There are many new things. And what I like most is the standard. No matter who you massage with, it's the same. Mildly fragrant massage oil The scent is aromatic. There are 3 scents to choose from. I like every scent. It's real Essential Oil. After massaging, I feel light. I feel comfortable doing facials. My skin is so clear that my friends ask me what I did. Most importantly, the skin is strong and doesn't burn as easily as before. I give it 5 stars. 	Have been a regular customer here for many years. All the masseuses are good. The shop is beautiful and clean. The music plays very well. I really like the herbal compress massage. Fresh herbal aromatic compress After the massage I felt very relaxed. Came for a massage with my daughter. That person likes to exfoliate the skin and get a Gluta massage. Now the skin is really whiter and smoother. I really like it. It's my favorite spa shop. 	Clean, the staff are very nice. After using the service, your face is comfortable and your body is comfortable. At the end, ginger juice, bael fruit juice, etc. are served, which can also be refreshing. 	I have been a customer for 6 years. I really like the body and foot massage here. Impressed with the service And the massage skills of the staff are excellent. So I have become a regular customer until today. 	I've been a customer here since the store opened. In total, it's been almost 15 years. I like and am impressed with the service and massage skills of the staff..Personally, I like aromatherapy massage because it's really relaxing..and I like foot massage too because I've tried many massages and I like this place the most. Because the massage is really different from other shops. It's a pressure point massage and also has herbal compresses..so it's a shop that I choose to do regularly all the time. It's been 15 years already...üëçüëçüëç 	Have been a customer here for more than 15 years, from the time the store opened until now. I like doing every treatment the staff recommends, facial massage, body massage, foot massage...I am very impressed with the quality and service here. I've always been a regular customer. Every time I come, I feel really relaxed and relieved of my aches and pains.. I like it the most.. 	In the past, I used to do physical therapy at the hospital due to office syndrome. Then I tried getting a massage here, which is a package especially for office people. I was impressed because the massage here was unlike anywhere else. Very comfortable, like feeling really relaxed. Came to try it for the first time and my shoulder pain disappeared. Shoulders like when getting a massage at a hospital, so you can tell how hard it is.

The spa is good, smells great. Today I did a bridal course. It was very good. The skin is very soft and smooth. I'll come use the service again. 	Be a regular customer here Massage since the shop opened I didn't go anywhere for a massage. It's next to the shop, next to the doctor, everyone is really good at masseuse. There's a place to wait and there's a cute photo corner. I really like it. 10/10 	The dung bomb here is the best. Very satisfying scrubbing, clear skin. The shop is cute, minimalist, the atmosphere is really good. The masseuses take very good care of you. 	Very good massage. Today I come to massage my neck and shoulders. The shop is so relaxing.

The shop and the staff provided good service. The massage was very good. The shop was very clean. I feel really relaxed. Entering the minimalist shop Very cute and pleasing. Come use the service often ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 	- The atmosphere in the store is good, clean, minimalist decoration. - Met a massage therapist who didn't complete the massage in full time. Started 15 minutes late but finished on time, not counting the actual start time. - Choose a Thai massage but it's more like a leg massage. During the head massage, stop massaging about 3 times, just touching the head.  Who is going to try it? But personally, it's a shop where I've gotten massages and I'm not impressed at all. 2 hours 600 baht. I still feel sorry for the money.	Today I came to get an Aroma massage for 2 hours. The shop's atmosphere is good, smells good, clean, there's plenty of parking. Dr. Na and the female doctor gave a very good massage. Will definitely come to use the service again. 	I drove down to Bangkok for several hours and was very tired so I looked for a massage shop. I found this shop. Good massage, very comfortable massage. After the massage there was no pain, very relaxing. 	I recommend it.

Affordable price  The staff provided good service, good massage, and I went home feeling comfortable. 	It's a good massage shop. The masseuse is very good, the hand weight is good, the acupressure is very good. (The masseuse's name is Noona). Good place, clean, good atmosphere. Will definitely come back for massage again. 	The shop is very good, clean, beautiful, has parking. Most importantly, the massage is very good. The masseuse's service is very good. I really like the aromatherapy massage. So satisfying. 	Massage shop, come try the scurf blasting course. The masseuse scrubbed every nook and cranny. The scum was spread out. The skin was clearer and the skin smoother. 	Come follow the review of the exfoliating bomb at Relax home Massage. I will say that it is very satisfying and comfortable. The shop's premium formula, especially the milk that smells so good. Ready to steam with herbs Followed by an explosion of dung. Finish with a Hokkaido milk cream mask. Cover with an infrared blanket and apply skin lotion. White skin really brightens. As they reviewed ü§ç 	Today I went to use the massage service at the shop for the first time. I was impressed by the admin staff who accepted the massage reservations. They spoke very well. Clean massage place Japanese minimalist style The service used is neck and shoulder massage, priced at 350 baht per hour.  The younger sister massaged with the masseuse, named Khun Rin, who massaged very well, was very hospitable, and always asked if it hurt.  As for the other masseuse, named Khun Suay, who massaged like she was not willing to massage, she massaged very rough, focused on using her elbows, didn't ask the customer, didn't ask the customer if it hurt or not. Until I massaged until there was still 5 minutes left before I asked. I'm going to massage my head but not wash my hands. After touching the body massage oil Then come and rub the head of the customer. This is the first time I've encountered something like this. I'm very shocked.  Overall, I recommend this shop. But you may have to choose a masseuse. I'd like to introduce you to Rin.

I would stay here again if I had the chance! I hope you will not miss the professional massage technicians who serve us so attentively! 	Very nice massage and they are very professional. Highly recommend üíïüíïüíï ‚Ä¶ 	Had great experience in having a Thai oil massage. The ambience is great with a good location. They accept all kinds of online and card payments. Worth a try! Definitely visit next time!üôèüíì ‚Ä¶ 	Very nice people! Massage was very good! And after they give you tea! That was also very nice tea 	Great massages near the airport. Good value and customer care. Pleasant dim lighting and music. Nice experience. üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Ä¶ 	Very professional Thai massage. highly recommend. Professional clean environment with very soothing and relaxing Thai music. In order to use Visa must have over 500 Baht expense. 	Excellent massage for my whole family, and nice tea ‚òï after that üíû Thank you very much üôèüôèüôè ‚Ä¶	2 hour deep tissue. Best yet. Relaxing, stretching and helpful with aches and pains . Real attentive service. 	Everything seemed standard but my particular masseur was not precise enough for me  I asked for an oil massage but they dressed me in the shirt and pants. The shirt opened up in the back, but still had sleeves on. And of course with the pants on it‚Äôs limited with oil 	Very good massages, the place is lovely and the workers are even more! Excellent! I recommend it 100% 	It was a pleasure massage by the professional üå∑ highly recommended ‚Ä¶ 	One of the best massages I've ever had in term of technique. The place is near the airport. I found it just on Google next to my hotel while waiting for the next flight. The masseuse is really professional, with a very confortable force which helps to relax and doesn't hurt. The price is quite cheap and you can take a hot shower after an oil massage. It'd be a very good idea between the flights. Sometimes it can be quite noisy if there are some noisy guests with their phones. 	Could someone please tell me the exact opening hours? I'm planning on visiting in March again. 	Great therapists, good in Thai Massage 	One of the best massages, i ever had, thank you üôè ‚Ä¶ 	Deng gives terrific massages. She really knows her work. Strong, careful and effective. If you're looking for a strong and good massage, ask for Deng. ü•∞ Also, the shop is clean and gives ginger tea after the massage.  The only thing I dislike is that some of the staff laugh at tourists when they come inside or ask for something. The staff will quickly exchange some looks and laugh. Not all of them, but some do it and it's not nice. I wish they wouldn't do that but just treat everyone with respect. Then it would be 5* from me. 	Staff friendly.  Pressure was just right.  Great techniques!
