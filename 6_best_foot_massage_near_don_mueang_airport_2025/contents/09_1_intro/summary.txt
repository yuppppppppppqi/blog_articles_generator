Meghalaya Traditional Massage
・Rating: 4.8
・Price: Budget-friendly
・Recommended: Ideal for those seeking genuine Thai massage with firm pressure, especially convenient for airport layovers.
・Hidden just minutes from Don Mueang Airport, Meghalaya delivers a <strong><u>truly authentic Thai massage experience</u></strong>. The dimly lit space with traditional Thai music creates the perfect environment to escape airport stress and travel fatigue. What makes this place special is their therapists' exceptional skill with <strong><u>deep tissue techniques</u></strong> that work wonders on jet-lagged bodies. They don't hold back on pressure—perfect if you prefer a massage with real therapeutic impact rather than just gentle relaxation. After your session, they serve complimentary ginger tea while you gradually return to reality. For the <strong><u>remarkable value</u></strong> and proximity to the airport, Meghalaya has become my go-to recommendation for friends with layovers needing <strong><u>serious relief</u></strong>.
