P Tim did my massage, she was very kind and did a great job. The shop is very clean, comfortable and staff is very friendly. Would highly recommend. I had the 90 minute aroma full body massage 	I came here on my last day in Thailand and wow! This place is very clean and very cozy. I loved the atmosphere and it was very relaxing. The staff was extremely kind and very welcoming. My masseuse‚Äòs name was Phet and she was very nice and she did a great job, 10/10. The prices were great too!! Loved the Bael drink they gave us after too.	Massage was very nice, professional and good price, recommend to everyone. 	Staff who did the massages complain all the time during the massage and talk over customer's head on the service date 6 December 2024 time 9 PM. Disgusting service ever. She said there are too many customers today and she didn't have the energy to massage. Why do I need to listen to immature services like this. Never again. 	üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGood massage, good service, good atmosphere ‚Ä¶ 	I was just there, took tradition Thai massage, they respect the time full hour, the lady that massage me was 100% real professional, she hit every muscule perfect, I feel so good üëç it was 300 THB per hour, I recommend this place to everyone. Pure 5 stars. Professionals, this is what I like. ‚Ä¶ 	This massage place is a must try. The owner is very accommodating. Their employees are well trained. Will definitely try again before we go back to the Philippines. 	The best massage experience! Highly recommended :) 	Impressed Foot Massage here. Good service. Good and clean environment. 	Good massage near don mueng airport, cozy vibeüòÅüòÅ ‚Ä¶ 	very relax for visiting here. foot massage 	Good atmosphere and good massage skills 	Good service and manner, friendly staff 	The store is clean. When you enter the store, it smells great. The staff are attentive and provide good advice and service. They speak because the masseuse is skilled. Request hand weight, heavy or light as desired. After the massage I felt very comfortable. I was very impressed. 	I had Thai massage with balm it was sooo amazing and really good. The pressure really hard and good enough for who like hard massage. This place really clean and reasonable price for service I will come back for sureüôèüëç  For people who frequently massage, it is considered heavy and can be used. Clean, quiet, relaxing. Anyone who has neck or shoulder pain, would recommend. 	Very good massage, clean shop, very nice staff. The owner of the shop is kind. Will go back to use the service again. I recommend this massage shop. Impressive service 	Very comfortable, very light. Very clean at the shop. So comfortable I fell asleep. The shop owners are lovely and take good care of you. I will definitely go often.
