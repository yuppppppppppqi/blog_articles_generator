P Tim did my massage, she was very kind and did a great job. The shop is very clean, comfortable and staff is very friendly. Would highly recommend. I had the 90 minute aroma full body massage 	I came here on my last day in Thailand and wow! This place is very clean and very cozy. I loved the atmosphere and it was very relaxing. The staff was extremely kind and very welcoming. My masseuse‘s name was Phet and she was very nice and she did a great job, 10/10. The prices were great too!! Loved the Bael drink they gave us after too.	Massage was very nice, professional and good price, recommend to everyone. 	Staff who did the massages complain all the time during the massage and talk over customer's head on the service date 6 December 2024 time 9 PM. Disgusting service ever. She said there are too many customers today and she didn't have the energy to massage. Why do I need to listen to immature services like this. Never again. 	💆🏻‍♂️Good massage, good service, good atmosphere … 	I was just there, took tradition Thai massage, they respect the time full hour, the lady that massage me was 100% real professional, she hit every muscule perfect, I feel so good 👍 it was 300 THB per hour, I recommend this place to everyone. Pure 5 stars. Professionals, this is what I like. … 	This massage place is a must try. The owner is very accommodating. Their employees are well trained.

When you enter the store, it smells great. The staff are attentive and provide good advice and service. They speak because the masseuse is skilled. Request hand weight, heavy or light as desired.
