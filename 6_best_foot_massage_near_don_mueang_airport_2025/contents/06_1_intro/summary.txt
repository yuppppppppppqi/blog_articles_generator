・Recommended: Great for those who prefer firm pressure massages at affordable prices in a simple but well-maintained setting.
・Tucked away near Don Mueang Airport, Fortune Massage delivers <strong><u>surprisingly high-quality treatments</u></strong> at prices that won't strain your travel budget. The simple, clean interior might not be fancy, but the therapists' skills more than make up for any lack of luxury decor. What impressed me most was their consistency in delivering <strong><u>firm, therapeutic pressure</u></strong> that works out travel kinks effectively. They don't shy away from deep tissue work when requested, making this perfect for those who find typical tourist-oriented spas too gentle. The complimentary bael fruit juice served afterward is a refreshing touch that completes the <strong><u>welcoming experience</u></strong>. While the setting is modest, the <strong><u>professional service</u></strong> and skill level are anything but—making Fortune an excellent value for travelers seeking genuine relief.
