I would stay here again if I had the chance! I hope you will not miss the professional massage technicians who serve us so attentively! 	Very nice massage and they are very professional. Highly recommend 💕💕💕 … 	Had great experience in having a Thai oil massage. The ambience is great with a good location. They accept all kinds of online and card payments. Worth a try! Definitely visit next time!🙏💓 … 	Very nice people! Massage was very good! And after they give you tea! That was also very nice tea 	Great massages near the airport. Good value and customer care. Pleasant dim lighting and music. Nice experience. 💆‍♂️ … 	Very professional Thai massage. highly recommend. Professional clean environment with very soothing and relaxing Thai music. In order to use Visa must have over 500 Baht expense. 	Excellent massage for my whole family, and nice tea ☕ after that 💞 Thank you very much 🙏🙏🙏 …	2 hour deep tissue. Best yet. Relaxing, stretching and helpful with aches and pains . Real attentive service. 	Everything seemed standard but my particular masseur was not precise enough for me  I asked for an oil massage but they dressed me in the shirt and pants. The shirt opened up in the back, but still had sleeves on. And of course with the pants on it’s limited with oil 	Very good massages, the place is lovely and the workers are even more! Excellent! I recommend it 100% 	It was a pleasure massage by the professional 🌷 highly recommended … 	One of the best massages I've ever had in term of technique. The place is near the airport. I found it just on Google next to my hotel while waiting for the next flight. The masseuse is really professional, with a very confortable force which helps to relax and doesn't hurt. The price is quite cheap and you can take a hot shower after an oil massage. It'd be a very good idea between the flights. Sometimes it can be quite noisy if there are some noisy guests with their phones. 	Could someone please tell me the exact opening hours? I'm planning on visiting in March again. 	Great therapists, good in Thai Massage 	One of the best massages, i ever had, thank you 🙏 … 	Deng gives terrific massages. She really knows her work. Strong, careful and effective. If you're looking for a strong and good massage, ask for Deng. 🥰 Also, the shop is clean and gives ginger tea after the massage.  The only thing I dislike is that some of the staff laugh at tourists when they come inside or ask for something. The staff will quickly exchange some looks and laugh. Not all of them, but some do it and it's not nice. I wish they wouldn't do that but just treat everyone with respect. Then it would be 5* from me. 	Staff friendly.  Pressure was just right.  Great techniques!
