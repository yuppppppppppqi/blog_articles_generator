The <strong><u>professional massage therapists</u></strong> truly understand how to work out travel-tired muscles.
<strong><u>Incredible value</u></strong> for an authentic Thai massage experience near the airport.
<strong><u>Deng's strong hands</u></strong> fixed my neck pain from the long flight instantly.
Their <strong><u>traditional techniques</u></strong> were exactly what I needed after 12 hours of flying.
The <strong><u>soothing ambiance</u></strong> with dim lighting and Thai music was perfect for relaxation.
Clean shop with <strong><u>attentive service</u></strong> and they even offered ginger tea afterward.
<strong><u>Deep pressure massage</u></strong> was exactly what my sore back needed. Highly recommend!
The <strong><u>relaxing experience</u></strong> was worth every baht and more.
Some staff laughed among themselves which made me feel a bit uncomfortable.
Requested oil massage but got dressed in pants and shirt which limited the experience.
