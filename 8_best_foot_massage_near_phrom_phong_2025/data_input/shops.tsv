I wish this can improve as it‚Äôs the basic! The place is nicely renovated and kept. Receptionist Ms Pim and masseurs Ms Mam and Tar are very nice, polite and always put on smiling face! They are considerate to keep our drink and fruits which we brought to be put into the fridge and returned to us after the massage. That‚Äôs a good service! We have an hour back massage + 15 min back massage with herbal compress ball, also we have an hour Thai massage with herbal compress ball. It‚Äôs very relaxing and it heals our back and shoulder pain with the herbal compress ball. At the end of the massage, we are given the compress ball and to re-use it at home, this is very good as most massage shops don‚Äôt give it to the customer even thought we paid for the compress ball. Another disappointing part is we saw their website promotion advertisement which has a 14% discount from Tues to Thursday and we came on Thursday but after we arrived the shop, we are told that such promotion has ramped down so we are not able to enjoy, hope that the company marketing can revise the website so that the customers are no longer being mislead. I‚Äôll keep my 5 stars to the massage shop for their awesome  service. 	Overall is was an amazing experience! We had the Thai massage+ herbal essence treatment and we were really satisfied with the experience :) The masseuses were very kind, experienced and had an amazing technique! Also, when you arrive in the store, you are welcomed with sweet tea and treats, and once the massage is over they give you the herbal treatment as a gift üòäüëçüèª I really recommend this place :) 	Highly recommend this place. Very clean and quiet. I think many of the massage parlors in Bangkok are located by the roadside and have poor noise insulation. Inevitable you will hear some traffic noise. There was quite minimal if that thankfully (I‚Äôm still reeling from a bad experience at another massage parlor with non stop renovation sounds) The therapist was attentive and strong and tried her best to manipulate my stiff tissues and bones. 	The therapists‚Äô massage skills were average. The terrified was the bed bugs.  We killed one bed bug with blood when we were having our after massage tea with gummy. We faster left the massage place and disinfected our bags and clothes when we returned the hotel.	The massage session simply awesome, i had a relaxed body after that. The environment is good, relaxing and calm. Their service was tip top and accomodating. Will surw back again in future. 	If you‚Äôre searching for the best massage in town, look no further than the serene oasis that combines expert techniques with a soothing ambiance to leave you feeling completely rejuvenated. Hot stone to aromatherapy, their highly skilled therapist like CO2 Aoy, tailor each session to meet your specific needs, ensuring the ultimate relaxation and stress relief. The luxurious spa environment, complete with calming music and aromatic scents, enhances the experience, making it a true escape from the pressures of daily life. Whether you‚Äôre easing muscle tension, recovering from a workout, or simply indulging in self-care, this is the place where your mind and body will thank you. Discover the unparalleled quality and care that have earned this spot its reputation as the town‚Äôs finest massage destination. The tea and jelly at the end was a sweet touch to the relaxing atmosphere. I personally booked through Klook. CO2 Aoy you have a therapeutic touch and relieved my stress from a very long flight! I will be back . 	Quite a decent Thai oil massage experience. The comfort level is quite high but with the price range we are paying, we were expecting a private room with a nicer setting. Recommend booking online in advance. 	You can try to pre-book the massage services online, as you can find some good deals. Otherwise if you walk in, availability may vary and even by paying the full price, I would say it is reasonable.  Masseur was good, you can let them know to reduce strength and they will adjust accordingly. 	This was a really good place for Thai Massage. The masseuse was super good at what she does - me with my low pain tolerance, she was able to match my level to make sure I was comfortable enough for the massage (note - Thai massage is not a gentle stroke to help you relax üòÖ). Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped in all the way to us leaving. Worth booking if you are ever in this area üëçüèª Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü 	This is the massage that I have been looking  and wanting for so long. It‚Äôs worth the travel as we stay at Silom. Therapists are all well trained and knows what real massage is. Will be coming back again for sure. Thank you 	loved the convenience of booking my massage via klook - this location did not require me to call after purchasing my voucher and i was able to book directly on klook. price is also competitive!  was surprised there was no feet wash prior to the massage but otherwise the massage was of great quality. this location would not be suitable for those with mobility issues as the rooms are located on the upper floors with rather narrow staircases. the bed was wide and comfortable, the clothes were of good quality (hope they can provide more plus sizes in the future). very happy w my massage and would most likely return :) 	Feel like in the heaven again, you have to try it and bring your family come together 	A wonderful experience. I had Som as my masseuse for my aromatherapy massage. It was definitely one of the top massages I have ever had, and the best massage I had for a long time. She knew where my tired muscles are and worked really hard on them. Thank you so much for the amazing two hours! I will definitely be back. 	Love the place! So clean and beautiful! All therapists are very skilled. I'm impressed every time I come. I've tried every programs and they're all good. I love Thai body massage + herbal compress and oil massages because they use good products. And I am not allergy to products even I have sensitive skin. 	The BEST thai massage! Definitely not something to miss when in Thailand. The service was great and the staff were very accommodating. There's also hot tea and free ice cream taste after the massage. I would definitely come back!! So worth it! üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Very good. We have herbal and thai massage for 60 mins. The massage is great. They even give us the herbal compress ball and a pack of ingredients for tea as gifts. 10/10, definitely will bisit again 	I tried traditional massage with herbal ball massage for 2 hours! Just so nice and the environment made me feel so relax.  Nearby Phrom Phong BTS station, 5-8mins walking distance!

My therapist, Ms. Tim, was incredibly skilled‚Äîshe worked out all my knots and made me feel completely relaxed. The atmosphere was so soothing, and I really appreciated the attention to detail throughout the session.  Honestly, it was one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had! I left feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the world. I can‚Äôt wait to come back every time I‚Äôm in Bangkok. If you‚Äôre looking for a great spa experience, I highly recommend checking this place out! 	Very nice atmosphere and service. I‚Äôd love to come back here. We all loved it. Thank you so much for ur work. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- I really-visited this same place after I really loved it. However the lady Ive had for the Thai massage had HORRIBLE skills, I had a painful time for 1 1/2hrs. I still have so much pain in my back, legs and arms. I think she doesn‚Äôt know how to massage or maybe she doesn‚Äôt wanna work at all. Also, she left for few mins twice during the massage, didn‚Äôt know why? And she rubbed my skin horribly without any oil or water, i felt so so much irritating on my skin. It was the WORST experience in bangkok. 	Nice and quiet place for relaxation and health massage. My masseuse Kaew and she did a very good Thai massage, relaxing and strong. A cup of herbal tea is served after the massage. 	Hidden gem in Bangkok that everyone must try. Highly recommended for those who look for massage with sophisticated skills that relief stress and muscle pain. The price is really cheap compared with those fancy spa, while the quality of massage delivered is beyond our expectation. Highly recommended! 	Finally experienced the long-awaited Thai massage! The masseuse's techniques were professional, the pressure was just right, and my whole body felt completely relaxed. It significantly relieved my shoulder and neck soreness‚Äîhighly recommend it to my friends! 	Don is so good, best forever. Its first time I experience such intense massage. I feel so relexed. I ve been here for 4 times almost everyday I stayed in bankok. My wife also likes here. This place makes us want to stay longer in bankok. 5 star. 	Excellent service, propper traditional Thai massage done by fully trained professionals.. leaves you both relaxed and rejuvinated at the end..  They were happy to accommodate my request to mix 2 massages in to the time I booked. 	Excellent massage. Been going for close to a year now and everything from the foot massage to the full body Thai massage has been perfect. The wife and I do not go anywhere else now that we have found this place. Highly recommend and very affordable for Bangkok near Sukhumvit. 	Visited in weekday afternoon. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. I love the warm welcome from the boss. P‚ÄôPang is my massager, she provided excellent service to me and i really enjoyed the time with her. Definitely worth the money and I will surly visit again. 5 stars! 	The masseuse was really good at foot massage. Room was nice and dark so I could relax on massage chair. Reasonable price and Christian owned business, will definitely come back here for quality service next time! 	My husband and I were looking for a foot massage and this lovely gem was right around the corner from our hotel. The facilities are clean and warmly lit, music is relaxing, and all staff were very kind and hospitable. The room where the foot massage took place is cozy. Pang (my massage therapist) was very sweet and had even asked if I get cold easily and she offered me a seat where it was warmer. This was my first foot massage and I was scared at first but it felt amazing! Pang was great‚Äî I highly recommend her. I would come again if I ever visit Bangkok again! 	I had an extremely relaxing hour and a great body massage here, the price is very cheap compared to the value received, Ms Nanny is so amazing, enthusiastic and thoughtful, i love there 	Whenever I visit Bangkok, Healthy Massage is at #1 on my list. Today, Jam treated me, and as always, they were professional and friendly. I will definitely be back. 	Best massage in town when you're in Bangkok! Be sure to visit them and have masseuses Fah and Tim work their magic to relax your body. Will definitely visit again next time! 	Tanam and Anya provided very good oil massage for us. It's so relaxing and want to back again. 	Have a good good experience in Health Massage. Ms. Pang is a skilled massage therapist, she impressed me with her skill. This is my first time here, and i will be back again in the future üíó ‚Ä¶ 	Today I had a foot massage service with a staff named Noey. She provided excellent service. I would like to recommend her and this massage shop. Thank you so much

Nut was incredibly professional and knew exactly how to work out the tension in my shoulders and neck. The pressure was perfect, and I left feeling so much lighter and more relaxed. You can tell she really understands the body and takes her time to focus on problem areas. Highly recommend her if you‚Äôre dealing with stress or sitting at a desk all day. Five stars all the way!	I had an amazing massage! The masseuse was able to use very firm pressure which I have not had in long time. They were very throughout and all my sore spots were seen to. The tea before and after was amazing. The spa is super nice, very clean and welcoming. They speak pretty good English too. Highly recommend. 	This is a hidden gem in Bangkok, highly recommend for everyone who visited Bangkok. We booked for 2hr of body scrub and aroma oil massage. The therapist has very good technique which addressed our pain points during the massage. The ambience of this spa is very cozy, almost fell asleep during the massage. Love it! 	It was great experience overall. Very clean and very kind. But i think body scrub needs to be changed. It doesn‚Äôt melt at all, for an hour therapist just really hardly scrub my body and it turns out super red and hurts. My skin is not really sensitive skin but since people came here for a vacation, it could be too rough for the skin. Massage was great! 	I had a wonderful experience! This place is a must try! The place has such a wonderful atmosphere and everyone is so polite.  I chose the herbal ground signature massage and the facial lifting and head massage.  The herbal ground signature massage was such a unique experience and one of the best ones I‚Äôve had so far. Close attention to details of the body and perfect pressure  The facial lifting and head massage left me with a baby skin, truly a must! 	I recently indulged in a hot coconut oil head massage, and it was nothing short of blissful. The warm oil, infused with its natural soothing aroma, was gently massaged into my scalp with expert hands, creating a deeply relaxing and rejuvenating experience. The therapist‚Äôs technique was perfect, with just the right pressure to release tension while promoting circulation. Overall, really great, highly recommended. 	I did Herbal Ground Refresh and it was amazing! Very relaxing and satisfying experience at a reasonable price :)  Staffs are very friendly and relaxing & cute vibe as well! They also serve tea before and after the massage.  Thank you for the wonderful experience! Will 100% come back again. 	A true oasis of serenity in the middle of the city! Had a fantastic massage , the place is clean and all staff extremely professional. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough for a moment of self-care.  I got a 60 minute aromatherapy massage, it was relaxing and released lots of tension in my back. 	I got a great organic facial here. It was truly wonderful and relaxing. You can tell the products are really fresh and good for your skin. The head massage was included and so relaxing. It‚Äôs a great price for quality experience. It‚Äôs a little tricky to find but my grab driver was able to find it. Highly recommend. 	Very nice atmosphere, staff friendly and was talking English. The service is amazing and I really enjoyed the tea, especially dragon blood one. They also have some items available for sale. Environment is very clean, which is great and puts the place on the higher level. I will be coming back for sure. Come for a good massage when you are in the area! :) 	A nice experience with a check in at reception to decide which part I wanted the masseuse to focus on and what aromatherapy oil ! I had the 2 hours package with an hour body scrub and an hour massage ! The place was clean and massage was good ! 	Great self care afternoon! üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Served by Mameow and Miow, I took the hair massage while my wife took the 30 minutes longer variant which includes a foot and shoulder massage.  The service was attentive and masseurs were professional. The ambience was cosy too, with tea served before and after the massage.  Great hidden spot to spend our afternoon, well worth the money and time spent üëçüèª 	Relax atmosphere. Professional staff. I had deep aroma Thai massage for 2 hours. Amazing service. My muscles are less intense. Will definitely come back. 	All ingredients used were perfect. Very calm and good atmosphere. They don't have private room !, Rest all is great, masseuse was wonderful at her job. Feeling refreshed after a long long time. 	I recently visited HERBAL GROUND for a Thai massage, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was calming and welcoming. The staff were professional, and the massage itself was incredibly soothing, combining traditional Thai techniques with a focus on relaxation and muscle relief. I felt completely rejuvenated afterward!  A huge thank you to the talented therapists for their skillful hands and attention to detail. Your dedication and expertise made this visit unforgettable. I'll definitely be returning and recommending this wonderful place to others! 	If you are in the area this spa is a MUST, they are cozy and amazingly comfortable. They have their own locally made products that smell and feel heavenly. I did the 4 hour deep sleep full message, facial and other perks!! You won‚Äôt leave unhappy. 	Chanced upon Herbal ground while looking for facial options and decided to walk in after seeing the reviews. Really comfortably and clean place, and thoroughly enjoyed the facial! It was simple, natural (not the type with machines - but they do explain what it includes) and I really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back!

The interior design blends beautifully with Thai elements, creating a peaceful and calming energy throughout the space.  I was greeted by the receptionist by name before I even introduced myself‚Äînow that‚Äôs impressive. Their warm and friendly welcome made me feel well taken care of before the treatment even began.  The welcome drink was fresh and delicious, the perfect refreshment after walking in from the hot sun. Before the treatment started, everything was explained to me in detail, which really put my mind at ease.  I had a facial treatment this time, and three days later‚Ä¶ wow. My skin has never felt so radiant, smooth, and glowing.  This place is highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself with top-notch service and guaranteed quality.	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a facial at Loft Thai Spa, Sukhumvit 38 in Bangkok, and it was truly one of the most relaxing and rejuvenating treatments I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was serene and inviting, with refreshing beverages and calming scents setting the perfect mood.  The staff was incredibly professional and attentive, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout the entire session. The facial itself was divine‚Äîmy skin was thoroughly cleansed, exfoliated, and it was feeling refreshed and glowing. The therapist‚Äôs technique was gentle yet effective, and I appreciated the extra care they took to personalize the treatment to my skin type.  I also loved the little details, like the relaxing facial, the complimentary foot massage and the warm tea and snack at the end, which made the experience feel even more luxurious. If anyone in Bangkok and looking for a top-notch spa experience, I highly recommend treating yourself to a facial here. It‚Äôs a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. 	A huge thank you to the entire team at Loft Thai Spa! My friend and I had an exceptional experience. The welcome was warm, the place was peaceful, and the massages‚Ä¶ simply amazing. It was both relaxing and rejuvenating. We left feeling calm and happy. Thank you again for your professionalism and kindness. We‚Äôll definitely be back! 	Totally exquisite experience from start to finish! I felt so relaxed and happy. I am so thankful to everyone who works here üôè they helped me choose the treatments for my needs, and the therapist who treated me was wonderful, used the perfect pressure and asked for feedback, made me feel very comfortable and was very professional. I have had a lot of foot massages, as I have chronic pain, and the foot massage here is the best ever. So relaxing. I did not want to leave after treatments! I will definitely return many times before I go home üíúüëå‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you to the lovely ladies in the receptionist and to the therapist, I did not get her name but she is fantastic üòç 	Absolutely fantastic experience! The massage was incredibly relaxing and tailored to my needs, relieving tension in all the right areas. The cupping was expertly done, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. The skin treatment was also top-notch, leaving my skin glowing and refreshed. The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire session. I walked out feeling like a new person! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comprehensive and excellent wellness experience. Five stars! 	Found Loft Thai Spa based on highest Google reviews. Some personal background I am a frequent wellness spa junky back home in Kuala Lumpur.  Admittedly nothing beats my personal masseuse who rolls me out knuckles and elbow until I‚Äôm mushed. Not for the faint hearted coz it can be painful but all my kinks will disappear after each session.  So since I‚Äôm on holiday I wanted a more relax feeling but still firm. This place met my wants and needs and the atmosphere + ambience + service was a bonus.  Love the skylight architecture. We went for the Aesop Facial Spa and Lady Spa Package. After each session we were given a lovely tea pot and bite size local delicacies.  Hip hip hoorah to Roxy for being a wonderful host and patiently entertained all our questions. Will definitely return again‚ù§Ô∏è 	I had the best massage of my entire life today!  Me and my friend took very long to decide what kind of massage we want and the receptionist was very patiently waiting and askied if we needed any help.  I have sensitive skin so I asked them to show me the products they use for their facial and they were kind enough to do that.  In the end, I went with 120mins aromatherapy deep tissue oil massage with coconut oil as suggested by them for people with sensitive skin and I left the massage with supple and smooth skin!  The entire massage experience starts with interacting with knowledgeable receptionist about the massages/facial they offer and a refreshing healing butterfly pea tea and hot towel for your hands.  After that, they provide a form for you to write down your massage strength preference, area of focus/avoid. You are then brought to a cozy, dimly lit, room with a private bathroom and outdoor shower for your massage.  The masseuse here clearly has better and more professional technique, it was the right strength to release the tension and knots in my body, I fell asleep briefly because I felt so relaxed during the massage.  You are given shower gel and lotion to shower after if you want to rinse off the oils. The massage experience ends with 3 types of dessert, pandan jelly cake, pumpkin shallots cake and coconut ondeh paired with herbal tea.  Would definitely come back again to treat myself! 	Loft Thai Spa is the must-go spa in Bangkok. You cannot miss this Amazing spa. My family and I visited twice in a week since it's so relaxing and comfortable. Professional massage and service. Big Thank You to Gie and our therapists (Apple and Cherry)! Our sore bodies will miss you all! ü•∞üòÜ 	Very nice and clean place. We very very good taken care of and the massage was holistic - from feet to body and head. People are extremely nice and good skilled. The only minus is a bit expensive. 	My friends and I came here because of all the amazing reviews and the facility looks clean. The staff were amazing, welcoming and accommodating. We got the welcome drink and after treatment snacks and tea, but the facial was mediocre. We paid $4800 baht/person, which is equivalent to $140 usd for the hydra-facial. This is considered pricey for Thailand, so we were expecting our face to be clean and glowing afterwards, it was not. The description on their website for the hydra-facial includes ‚Äúextraction‚Äù, upon arrive we were told no manual extraction, the only ‚Äúextraction‚Äù we were getting is from the suctioning of the hydra-facial machine. The facial ‚Äúmassage‚Äù and foot bath felt more like a caress than a massage. My face felt exactly the same after, grimy with black heads and milia. I came back to the hotel and rewashed my face. For the price we paid, we would not go back for mediocre results. I rather pay a little more in America for medical grade hydra-facial where they actually cleanse and extract your pores. 	Had a lovely experience! Went for my first prenatal massage at 16 weeks and the masseuse made sure I was comfortable with sufficient pillows and checked in with me now and then. The massage was comfy with a good amount of pressure! 	It was a great experience. A little pricey but great. Would recommend the half day spa with body scrub, hot stone oil massage and facial 	What an outstanding experience. My husband and I requested the couples indulgence package. It was 3 amazing hours of truly some of the best treatments we have ever received. The esthetics of the spa are tasteful and calming and the service is 5 star quality. Worth the trip. So happy we found them. 	Great place to have a good massage, good facial and a pampering time! The Thai massage was really good and so was the facial. They serve you with a drink before the spa and snacks after. The receptionists speak very good English and reservation can be made easily though WhatsApp as well. Would recommend this place though it‚Äôs more expensive than other Thai massage places but you get a great massage that relieves your knots! 	The staffs were great! I went to treat fatigue and soreness‚Ä¶ I got to relax and alleviate almost all soreness. Great service and tea! 	This spa in Bangkok is truly exceptional! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The masseuses are highly skilled, especially with their pregnancy massage techniques. They even surprised us with a thoughtful gift for our baby, showcasing their commitment to customer care. I wholeheartedly recommend this spa for anyone seeking a top-notch relaxation experience! 	Lovely spa that provides massages and spa treatments with smiles and desserts! On the expensive side but totally worth it if you want to splurge on yourself!

The staffs welcomed us with so much warmth and love. The treatment in itself was marvellous. It was so good that both of us snored at some point during the process. They were the very friendly, very communicative, very lovely each and everyone of them. At the end, both me and hubby were surprised by the staff for their thoughts and dedication to making our experience an out of the world one. They offered us a very big bouquet of roses and the most sweetest and cutest of cake ever to celebrate our anniversary. I was over the moon from the whole experience. Looking forward to coming back soon ü©∑ü©∑ü•∞ü•∞  We were asked from the very start of any allergies we have. We were given the choice of aroma we wanted in our massage. Their washroom is so clean. Overall a 100 stars for the whole experience 	One of the best thai massage experiences I‚Äôve had in Bangkok. From the warm welcome to the treatment itself and the tea in the end, everything went well. Special thanks to miss First for the massage. Definitely more expensive than your random massage parlor on Sukhumvit Road but better value for money. 	OMG! I was blown away by the Deep Tissue (90mins) and Intensive Facial - Aesop Products (60mins), both by masseur Ms. Rin. Walking into the spa being greeted by a gentleman staff (I‚Äôm sorry I forgot your name!) so warmly, it felt like a 5 star hotel spa and indeed they were! I was welcomed by their Detox blue drink whilst the staff chatted with me on the art gallery displaying of local artists artworks next to it. (Love this as a visual artist myself, I applaud them for creating a platform for local talents.)  Don‚Äôt be fooled by the masseur Ms. Rin‚Äôs physique cause she gave me the best massage I‚Äôve had here in BKK! She might be young but she massages like a pro who has been doing this all her life! I was floating in heaven from her medium-hard massage and her facial was simply awesome too! This spa was not far by distance from my hotel but the usual horrendous traffic BKK is known far is something to consider if you can‚Äôt walk to it. But nevertheless no regrets here, because from start to finish I was treated like a queen as you‚Äôre served with a teapot of tea with come local sweets after your massage! Price point wise, they are expensive by local standard but their quality is above and beyond! My experience here was worth every dime! 	We had such a lovely experience at this thai spa called NAKHON. We brought my mother in for a massage, and she came out absolutely glowing ‚Äî she said it was one of the best massages she‚Äôs ever had. The staff were incredibly gentle, respectful, and professional. They took the time to ask about her preferences and made sure she was comfortable throughout the entire session.  While my dad and I waited, the staff offered us complimentary drinks and made us feel very welcome. The waiting area was quiet and cozy and amazing view of Bangkok!  ‚Äî a great place to relax. After my mom finished, they surprised us with free mango sticky rice, which was such a thoughtful and delicious treat.  It wasn‚Äôt just a massage ‚Äî it felt like a full experience of Thai hospitality. You can really tell they care about their guests. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and be treated with genuine warmth. We‚Äôll definitely come back the next time we‚Äôre in Bangkok! 	I highly recommend the Loft Thai Spa! They offer an excellent services, I‚Äôm very impressed by Loft‚Äôs attention to every single detail, design, customer service, hello and goodbye drinks, high quality products and professional massage therapists. My 2 hours Lavender oil massage was the perfect way to unwind, relax and it was worth every penny. My massage therapist Ms.Nee was very professional, highly skilled, kind and I felt very looked after. Will be back soon! Thank you Loft ! 	A Heavenly Thai Massage Retreat - [LOFT THAI]  Walking into [LOFT THAI], I was instantly charmed by the warm Thai decor and inviting aroma. The staff greeted me with huge smiles, making me feel right at home.  The massage therapists are true pros. Their skillful hands, well-versed in traditional Thai techniques, worked wonders on my tired muscles. Knots I'd carried for ages melted away under their firm yet gentle pressure.  An hour there felt like a mini-vacation for my body and mind. If you're after relaxation and rejuvenation, this place is a must-try! Five stars, hands down! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü 	One of the best massage ever. Ambiance was very relaxing and great too. Therapist were courteous and good. We had First & Nee, they are both good will be back the next time! ‚ò∫Ô∏è 	I was hesitant to spend so much money on a gentleman's Hydrafacial, but wow what a memorable experience. My therapist Jasmine was amazing, from the moment I walked in the door everything was perfect, the staff were all very friendly and attentive. The facial was unbelievably good, everything Jasmine did was peaceful and done so delicately. It was worth the money and I am now leaving feeling so refreshed and good about myself. 	I‚Äôm here on a last stop for a four month voyage! I came here to Loft Thai reviews! It did not disappoint. You must come here!  Lek give me the best Hydro facial I‚Äôve ever had. It was 90 minutes:  micro dermabrasion, Hydro Facial getting all the junk out, aloe vera serum. She massages you for l10 minutes then there‚Äôs another coconut oil serum, she lifts up your skin with a great fade tool. Next comes the green tea/honey/yogurt face mask with steam. At certain times she massages your head, your neck, your temples. Finally, she washes off the skin, puts another serum on  and sunscreen!  They give Top Class customer service! They served me: hot tea, butterfly cold, tea, and the most amazing little sweet potato and coconut treats. They treated me with kindness and the BEST service! 	After few days of holding my pain n decided to come this place because of their good on google review, the staff here very helpful, they help me choose the Sport Massage, which is wonderful, my pain is much more better now. Thank you all of you! Would definitely come back again n they have such a beautiful decoration there. 	I have come to Loftai with Office Syndrome Massarge due to stress and pain in my shoulders. The massage staff is very good, so I can relax and reduce my muscle aches. Good service and location, I recommend and will definitely come back. 	Really lovely and luxurious massage. I chose the lady package included a foot scrub, full body massage and an Aseop facial at the end. For everything it cost ‡∏ø4000. It was very peaceful and relaxing I fell asleep! You get your own private room and there is a shower afterwards as well. The spa itself is very beautiful and aesthetic, it‚Äôs a nice treat to go here! 	Clean massage place. I had a relaxing time with my spouse here at Loft Thai spa, and we throughoutly enjoyed ourself with the Couple Indulgence. 10/10 will be back 	Great ambience and extra friendly staff.  I booked a deep tissue massage and was not disappointed.  The masseuse was highly skilled and worked out tension I was storing in my neck, shoulders, and back.  Ultimately I was relaxed and tension free.  Definitely would do again.  Book early as this location is popular. 	This spa is conveniently located very close to the sky train (BTS), it is a little bit of a walk but not too far. It is located in a small alleyway. It was an absolutely delightful experience. I redeemed a voucher here and I didn‚Äôt realize I had two but the hosts were extremely kind and helpful. They created a really calm and welcoming atmosphere. We were welcomed with some ice cold sweet tea that was perfect because it was sweltering hot outside. They had a quick questionnaire about any problem areas to focus on, strength of massage and what places to avoid. This place is a great place to experience the famous Bangkok Thai massage with the opportunity to add on to your initial package. Had I known about this place earlier in my trip I would have visited a number of times before I left. We were allowed to wind down in the foyer with some traditional Thai rice cakes and hot tea.  Business that take the time to master customer service are businesses bound for success. This is one of those businesses. 	Seriously top class service very professional I went for the Thai Warrior style massage it was excellent . I‚Äôve never really experienced before anything like it before Great ancient authentic technique strong massage not recommended for newbies.  Aesthetic beautiful like Aesop vibes minimal luxury decor very consistent little bit pricey but worth it 	Walked in to Loft Thai Spa via google without an appt. Was treated with a very warm welcome by the staff. Managed to arrange a hot compress massage withij 5mins of waiting and also allowed me to take a quick shower before the treatment. The therapist was skilful and I felt so much better from the body aches after the massage. Thank you to the front desk staff who arranged everything so seamlessly! Will definitely come again in future trips to BKk! Highly recommended!

A small, but well staffed professional massage venue. Therapist K. Pook gave me a Swedish massage with a focus on a stiff/locked shoulder per my request.

She enjoyed the massage and said she was very relaxed afterwards.  I highly recommend going here for therapeutic massage. 	My first foot and shoulder massage here and I had the therapist Ratsamee. She is so gentle yet skilled in her massage. I had a lot of tension from work but she massaged it all away. The price is also affordable and place is clean and nice. Thank you and hope to come again! 	Great service. So nice and accommodating. You start with a cold tea before your service. I got the office syndrome with oil. Just what I needed after the long plane ride. At the end she cracked my neck and back. Then you finish with a hot tea and yogurt. I'll definitely go back again before I leave. 	They served different types of tea (with benefits description) before and after the massage and also ended with a plate of salad. Masseuse was skilled and generally the crew were all super nice! Very pleasant experience! 	This place is amazing and a great service! I had foot scraping and pedicure. They did a fantastic job for make my feet looks natural and more glossy. I‚Äôm impressed with their professional works. Highly recommended! 	My fianc√© and I came here for a herbal oil Thai massage. And in one word it was fantastic! Ja O was really attentive and expert at her craft. Will definitely come back soon! 	I recently had an aroma massage at Eszence, and it was nothing short of magical. It didn‚Äôt just soothe my body‚Äîit brought a deep sense of inner peace and healing. The care and hospitality I received were truly out of this world. I‚Äôm so grateful for the experience and already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Eszence, for such a soulful touch!üåº‚ù§Ô∏è 	It was such a welcoming place and I felt so relaxed. The staff are super sweet and attentive.  Left feeling luxurious and pampered. They have used the space so efficiently. My 1st ever Thai massage and it really lived up to the name. Highly recommend this place. No wonder they have such good ratings. Hope to back the next time I visit Thailand. 	Had a very good aroma massage by senior therapist Ja-O! The massage was firm and so relaxing. I will come back again and again since they accept bookings on Whatsapp. Worth the price! 	This was the far best massage I've ever had in my ENTIRE life ü§Ø K. Arty for me and my mom had Ice. They were not only thorough and so experienced but also nice and caring. We were both sooo satisfied and walked out with big smiles! Wish we found this place earlier so that we could visit twice ü•≤ (and they were also very accommodating and understanding when I had to cancel for the first time due to the heavy traffic on the road!!) 	Me and my husband said the same idea about this massage experience, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the best massage I‚Äôve had ever!!‚Äù, I thought I tried so much in my life, but this experience was so wonderful, highly recommend‚Ä¶‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 	Professional staff, clean, and calm environment. Nui was an exceptional masseuse. Tea before, after, & a tasty salad after was icing on the cake :) I higly recommend this spa when in Sukhumvit, Bankok! 	For someone who goes to massages very often i can tell the difference between a good one and one that‚Äôs not really it. If you come for a relaxing massage, very much recommend. The staff is extremely friendly and you get a nice drink as a starter with included information what it‚Äôs good for. At the end you also recieve a nice tea with some fruit and yogurt. Hospitality 10/10. 	Very satisfying experience. Staff members are nice and friendly. My massage was very therapeutic! The massage lady knows well about what she's doing, even though she has almost killed me with the pain!!! üòÜ But I feel like reborn now ü§£ü§£ü§£ ‚Ä¶ 	I had a great foot massage at Eszence Massage and Spa in Bangkok! The staff was very friendly and professional. The therapist did an amazing job, using the right pressure to make my feet feel relaxed and refreshed. The spa was clean and quiet, with soft music and a nice smell. It was a very relaxing experience. I will definitely come back again. Highly recommended!

After the massage, hot tea and dried fruits are served. I felt completely refreshed! 	We found this shop via FunNow App.  I had an amazing experience here. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was incredibly welcoming. The massage was tailored to my needs, with just the right pressure, leaving me feeling completely rejuvenated. The attention to detail, cleanliness, and calming ambiance made the experience even better. I‚Äôll definitely be returning! 	It was okay when I made the reservation, but it began to be unhappy when I arrived. I agreed when I made a reservation, but I had to wait when I arrived, and I was asked to pay first. I hope the technology can be better, and I will evaluate it when it's over. 	The massage technique here is very bad, and the attitude of the front desk is also bad,literally don‚Äôt understand what you said at all. I came according to the evaluation of Google Maps. I have been massaging for many years. And have tried good and bad. This is definitely a bad kind; this masseur can only massage back and forth for several positions and the oil get your feet very bad feeling. In short, spends money but has no sense of enjoyment at all. Not recommended. 	I can highly recommend the massage. For me it was one of the best I've ever had. Very nice ambience. It's absolutely worth paying more. The service is excellent. I had a one-hour aroma massage and the masseur is a real magician. Not the typical rubbing that you usually get from massages. I'll be back. 	One of the best experience ever here in Bangkok for massages. Staff extremely professional and nice, clean rooms, attention for details. I was expecting high level standards considering the reviews: I have not been left disappointed. 	Very comfortable, good environment. The price also very nicely. 	Purchased a package on GoWabi, and the staff welcomed me in and quickly got me up to my room for my massage. The massage was perfect, very relaxing with good pressure and technique to get my knots out.  The space was clean and smelled good. I will be returning soon for another massage. 	There‚Äôs a reason why Google and Gowabi have a high rating. I got a Thai massage and it‚Äòs as cool as stretching! I‚Äôm tired with a heavy load, but I‚Äòm satisfied. I want to get an oil massage next time!! 	Best experience ever, staff was good and it was really relaxing. Recommend ü•∞üëçüèΩ ‚Ä¶ 	A great choice. Brand new facilities, very tastefully designed and immaculately clean. Over all great relaxing atmosphere, friendly service, accommodating and good English. The message was superb.

The boss was a great host. Shall bring strawberries next time as thank you üòä	I just arrived from Melb this morning and I was very tired.

This also help me to choose the right program :) 	June, is a good listener, Made sure to apply the right amount pressure at the right place‚Ä¶ My body feels rejuvenated‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend to come here‚Ä¶ Soi 22 Thai Thai Massage is very clean and well Organised.. 	Had an amazing visit at Thai Thai. The staff was talented, the environment was soothing, and the massage itself was first-rate. Just the ideal mix of pressure and relaxation.  Perfect for decompressing following an exhausting day.  Strongly advised for everyone seeking a real Thai massage. 	Excellent service and treatment at Thai Thai massage!  The foot üë£ massage is one of the best I've ever had, very worth the money üí∞ They also accept credit cards üí≥ for all services, so that is definitely an added bonus for me, as I prefer not to have a wallet filled with cash walking around Bangkok.  Definitely a good place to drop by for some relaxing üòå and wonderful friendly staff üòÄ do drop by for sure üòÅ 	Had a really good oil massage here. The therapist, Noon, was lovely and had strong hands with excellent technique üí™‚ú®  very professional and attentive. The room was clean, relaxing üßºüïØÔ∏è, and the massage oil felt high quality. It‚Äôs a bit on the pricey side üí∏, but definitely worth it for the experience. I also appreciated the small touch at the end they served a really delicious tea üçµ after the treatment. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quality massage! üå∏ 	I always go to this chain of massage salons. This is the best massage in Bangkok. Everything is new and clean, and the staff is great. The massage is worth the price, and I recommend it to everyone! 	Absolutely amazing!!! I got there by chance and boy, what a wonderful surprise it was. I had an oil aromatherapy massage, and I suffer from nimblling arms and back pains. I wondered to myself at what stage should I tell about it but felt so secure by the extremely professional masseuse (Fong) that I kept my thoughts to myself and let her do the magic. I immediately felt much better what I could barely say after long treatments by physiotherapists back home. Thank you so much, Fong!!! Thank you, Thai Thai massage!!! 	I loooove this place! It is located right next to Marriott Marqui Queen‚Äôs Park. I have been here twice already within two days. I have 5 more days on my trip & I will be back to try a couple other services.  They are currently running a BOGO free special on select services. I brought my mom to try this place after my initial visit. I did the Thai massage & the Siamese Aromatherapy Oil Massage + Hot Compress (this is one of the buy one get one free options). Both were awesome! the staff is friendly and the place is very clean & cute. 	Excellent service. Very friendly staff and able to accommodate to your massage needs. Clean and tidy place.  Price was very affordable as they have an ongoing promotion at 50% every 2nd service.  Would come back again! 	The decoration of the place and the colors are the most eye-catching in this area, The introduction of  details in each menu from the counter is quite fair and honest with customers, The interior of the place is clean and there are no staff talking loudly inside, It is really professional image, The staff are so polite and pay attention to her work, I felt this in my 90 minutes, I really appreciate it, anyway one thing I must say is... first I,m sure that not all of staff are the same but my experience (different staff) at second time was not good at first time, >> when customer asked for relaxing massage and not too hard massage,,, as human beings  must listen to this,  staff should not push customer to take the pain, when customer asked to stop,,,it's painful, then stop it and do it softer, gently,  if the customer asked for relaxing, not too hard, so just do it, however I still give the tip to staff as the same just like the first time, but the experience was not good. 	Came for the second time and was üòç amazed how good the therapist was this time I got a chance to get relaxed my therapist kati was so good with her work especially when I asked her to apply some more pressure and she was kind enough to ensure she could try her best .this place makes me feel so relaxed .I just did a foot massage which was extremely relaxing.thank you 	The most proper way to relax. A few dollars more can get you very far away. Remember to tip these nice friendly ladies. The bright atmosphere makes huge contrast to their neighbours. Located right in the middle of the shopping and the hotel areas. The door is bright and easy to find. 	It was an amazing experience. The place was clean and calm and service was top notch. It's a must go place in bangkok 	I had an amazing experience at the place. Very kind and great massage. Clean and friendly.	The thai massage nearly emsphere is very reasonable price and staff are kindly and also friendly if you giy looking for the authentic thai massage i would like to recommend to vist thai thai massage so incredible relaxüòä ‚Ä¶ 	I‚Äôve had one of the best massage at Thai Thai , Manao the masseuse was very professional, and worked well on my stiff and muscles. I highly recommend this place .

Cute foot spa amongst many in this area. Just a short walk up Soi 24 from Phrom Phong BTS station. Also right across from EMporium Shopping Mall.  This small shop has a beach like vibe. It was clean and the staff were well trained and professional.  I book through GoWabi APP. No pressure but if use my discount code 'travis-1716046' you save ‡∏ø100 off your first booking! 	This is amazing place for massage, feel so cozy, clean, good service staff always smile very professional,  highly recommended ü´∂üèæü´∂üèæ ‚Ä¶ 	Amazing service. The facility is clean, modern and well-decorated. Pricing is about 300-400 bhat for Thai massage 60 mins. They give you discount if come before 5p.m (so called happy hours). Staff polite and have good techniques. Thumbs up! 	Unfortunately I had an unpleasant experience.  It‚Äôs open walls so the guy next to me was snoring and moaning really loud to the point he started snorting.  The staff is nice but the massage itself is pretty average.  I paid for their best recommended (2hrs body relaxation).  I think they‚Äôre normal foot/leg massage looks decent but wouldn‚Äôt recommend a full body massage. 	Randomly went into this massage parlour at 9:30pm and it was the best decision ever. They only take cash but anyways I chose the Deep Tissue Thai Massage with Thai Balm and i was surprisingly impressed the lady masseuse was strong & hit all the right aching spots. I have been to a few other massage places around Bangkok and they were all high end and all disappointing, so glad to suddenly chance upon this massage place which wasn‚Äôt expensive and gave me the best massage ever ‚ù§Ô∏è  Look for a girl named ‚ÄúTae‚Äù , she massaged me so well eventho I didn‚Äôt direct her to my aching spots. Blessed to have gotten her on my last night in Bangkok ‚ù§Ô∏è she deserves all the tips üëèüèª 	Randomly chanced upon this massage store and decided to give it a try because it‚Äôs always crowded (this was before we saw the reviews). Turned out to be one of the best decision on our trip.  I did a 1 hour foot massage and my husband did a 1 hour 4-in-1 which is foot shoulder head and neck.  My masseur for foot was fantastic!! Right amount of strength which really helped to relieve the ache. Lots of focus on the sole of the foot which I enjoyed. They also apply oil for the massage which felt really good.  I like that the Chair could be inclined so very comfortable. They also offered me a change of pants because I was wearing a dress.  Even though the space is open it was quite quiet and relaxing.  Note that they only accept cash here and you get 100baht discount for selected massage if you visit before 3pm.  Highly recommend ! We might just be back again :) 	Chanced upon this massage shop in the Phrom Phong area. Since my feet was aching from all the walking, decided to go for an hour of foot massage. In that street along itself, I counted another few more massage shops nearby. The shop has a nice ambience, with soft music playing in the background. The receptionist was friendly and they many many massage package to suits everyone.  I opted for the 60mins foot massage which was 420baht, not the cheapest in Bangkok but still okay. Upon making my payment, i was then ushered to the back of the shop to have my feet clean. The massage felt good, my feet felt more relieved from the sore.  If you happen to be staying around that area, can consider giving their massage a try. 	The shop atmosphere is good. The masseuse massages gently and seems lazy. I told her to massage harder, but she nodded in acknowledgement, but the massage was the same. The price is expensive. I've been here twice and been disappointed twice. If I don't come again, it's not worth the money. 	Clean, nice and calm athmosphere. Good massage (4 in 1 therapy), the foot massage was with a perfect pressure. Before 5 pm happy hour with 100bht discount. 	I had a massage with Poy from the Thai Thai next to the JW Marriott Marquis and she was beyond FABULOUS !!!! Strongly recommend going and only asking for her - if you want to relax and get more value for your money 	Honestly upset with my experience here. We paid for a couples with the aroma with the hot compress. I didn't want super deep pressure, but not light either. First, nobody asked at all what we wanted, or about the pressure. Then, there was no aroma at all.. and usually you get to choose which kind of aromatherapy. There wasn't any the entire time. The hot compress was only used for about 5 minutes. And my entire 'massage' felt like a very fast and light lotion application. No massage. There therapists kept talking to each other and laughing. It felt uncomfortable. It's my birthday today, and this was a disappointing experience. It really feels like I wasted my time. 	Came here without fail every night of our trip. Definitely 5stars. Look for Mo or Rat. Extremely great massage service you will get from them! There are two thaithai massage on the same street! Go to this one! Both masseuse and price is better. 	Unfortunately my least favorite massage in Thailand so far. Aggressive, erratic, not very symmetrical. I‚Äôm sure there are some lovely therapists but unfortunately I got a bit unlucky. Left in a bad mood. 	The Thai massage was great. Feel very relaxed after.. and the atmosphere of the massage place is so clean and nice. 	I enjoyed my 90mins Thai massage here. It costs me only 500baht (after 10% discount) and the service was really good. Even without discount, the massage is 400baht per hour. It‚Äôs much cheaper than the massage within the central area. There are several floors in the place and you will be brought to upstairs for getting the thai massage. The air con here could be a bit cold, please make sure you let them know if any adjustment is needed. 	I left this place feeling very stressed.  First, the place is not very clean. There is only one toilet and it's old and dingy. Second, the massage was so bad I actually stopped in the middle and asked to speak to a manager. I get regular  massages and this was the first time in my life I've asked the masseuse to stop. It felt like a kid was just slapping their hand back and forth. She also kept getting the scrub cream in my hair until I asked for a hairnet or towel.  When I tried to speak to the manager to change the person, they said it was too late and that it had been over 10 minutes. I tried to explain that I did stop within 10 minutes and time was spent trying to explain to the masseuse and time for her to go get a manager. I ended up just cutting the massage short as I felt so uncomfortable there.  I had gotten a body scrub, and afterwards they give you a  towel and walk you down the hall to this dirty little shower to rinse off. I had to just walk in my towel back to the room to get dressed.  Afterwards, the front desk hardly seemed to care or offer any apologies. This was a horrible experience. 	To be fair, it‚Äôs one of the really clean places with very good massage but the 60 minutes turns out to be 45 minutes of actual massage, other than that I would have definetly given them 5 stars

This is because Koreans are very picky. If you visit this place, you might feel that spending money at similarly priced or higher-end shops would be a waste. If you found this place on Google Maps, I recommend visiting and getting a massage. 	What a perfect massage experience it was!!!! Super clean building and professional massage therapist who knows the muscle 100% without unnecessary pain at all. The manager of the spa kept an eye on every procedure of massage from your entrance to leaving the spa! I bet that's why the whole thing which includes the quality of massage itself and relaxing atmosphere, etc.. about getting massage is well-managed. SUPER RECOMMENDABLE!!! 	I got a 120min, 4 hand massage here. My experience was really good, warm welcoming, helping, and the massage was really enjoyable, I love the coconut oil, and the teas as well üôÇ I can recommend! Thank you! 	Amazing massage. Went twice for foot then 4 hand massage both which I highly recommend. The spa is tucked in the back of an alley so nice and quiet inside. Super relaxing and great massages! 	I just got back from DIO Spa & Massage in Sukhumvit Soi 22. As a regular traveler to Thailand for over 15 years, this was the most epic treatment i have ever got so far. Amazing massage, by therapist Doung, she is so professional and hard working. 5/5 Stars! 	Been here twice, each time I walk out thinking that was the best massage I'd had. Two years between visits and still outstanding!!  Very relaxing atmosphere and world-class staff. 	Highly recommend, no nonsense, great massage. The building is nice inside with a colonial feel and calm ambience. They open at 10h, I went early. The reception is kind and business-like, I asked for max strength massage and I was quickly assigned a masseuse, Khun Duong, who was super hard working and like a magician got the knots out of my back. I was offered a cool drink on arrival and a warm delicious tea at the end. The experience overall is very professional and sharp. 	Very clean and skill professional! Highly recommended. 	It was a special experience in Bangkok and the massage here should be the best to close the trip happily. Especially, Aromatherapy oil massage & Herbal ball in 90~120mins is highly recommended for the old people. The massagists should have fine and delicate senses and were trying to find pain points for us. Thank you for the good staff for my parents again. 	Do not expected a good service if you are Thai, seems like they don‚Äôt wanna get any Thai customers. No one notice me since I arrived, everyone always with their cellphone, not smiling no any service mind at all ( may happens only with Thai) 	I‚Äôve been there 3 times with my friend within one week! Definitely the BEST massage I ever had. Kind owner and staff, reasonable price with good quality oil, literally a paradise place to be. Thank you all!! :) 	It was the perfect massage. They massages the exact lumped muscle position. It was the best time of my trip. The service couldn‚Äôt be better. I asked them a favor regarding personal lost and found, and they were very supportive. Highly recommend. 	As I‚Äôm sitting here drinking tea after my 2 hour massage. Great professional massage. MIB was excellent with the right amount of pressure. I had the Thai + Aromatherapy massage and location is clean and the service great. Will come again for sure. 	Nice place to get a decent massage. Abit more expensive than the rest along the road but more private and quiet 	I have to admit that this place is one of the top spa for massage in Bangkok. Today was my 4th time already since I started to come here. The place and the staff were super good and would rate this place as 7 star . 	thank u for keeping the lost thing wellüôè even though I arrived late due to the tour, they allowed me to massage until late, so gave a little tip there r a lot of Koreans because of the connection to the tour 	Excellent experience here.  Nam was great at changing pressure when needed.  Plus drinks were given  before and after.
