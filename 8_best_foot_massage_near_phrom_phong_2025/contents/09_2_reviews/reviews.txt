<strong><u>Masseuse Tae</u></strong> found every sore spot in my feet. Best reflexology ever!
Happy hour discount before 5pm made the foot massage super affordable.
<strong><u>4-in-1 massage</u></strong> was perfect after shopping at Emporium. My feet thank you!
Clean chairs and oil-based foot massage was so relaxing I dozed off.
<strong><u>Convenient location</u></strong> near BTS with skilled therapists. Perfect combo!
Their beach-like decor creates such a relaxing atmosphere for tired feet.
<strong><u>Mo's foot massage technique</u></strong> was amazing. Just the right pressure to release tension.
Loved the foot massage chair that reclines. So comfortable for a full hour!
The atmosphere was nice but my therapist's pressure was too light despite requests.
Massage was shorter than the 60 minutes I paid for. Left feeling a bit rushed.
