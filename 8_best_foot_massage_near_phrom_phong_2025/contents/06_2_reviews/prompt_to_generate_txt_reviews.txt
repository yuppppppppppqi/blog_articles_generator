It cost 500 baht which I think is beyond I expected. I totally fall asleep and really enjoyed it. After the massage there’s a plate of fruits and veggies rather than sweet mango 🥭 with rice. I think is great too .  Anyways I will be back again ! Also recommend any of you if you are expecting to have a normal price and great service.	Amazing Swedish massage 💆‍♀️ I have ever had!! Omg the lady I had her name is ok ✅ and so I will go back to her because I love the way she was pounding on me!!  It was so so good!! My friend from Canada 🇨🇦 was in and she got the oil aroma therapy and was so happy with her experience as well!  To drop it off to give you a little yogurt yummy dish with fresh fruits in it as a refreshing after massage  and they give you a tea before the massage!  I love the water rubs they bring to wash your feet!! 👣  Hi this place I’m going back for sure I will get the sweetest massage the  Swedish one and see if I can get one for two hours it was amazing truly it was so good!  OK so my fellow foodies I’m also gonna share my massage experience - incredible make sure you follow us here as well as social media channels trying to grow our database for new fellow foodies that want to try and experience amazing restaurants in Bangkok!! 	A small, but well staffed professional massage venue. Therapist K. Pook gave me a Swedish massage with a focus on a stiff/locked shoulder per my request. The massage was good and was highly effective in unlocking my normal range of motion and relaxing my muscles. My wife opted for the hot stone therapy. She enjoyed the massage and said she was very relaxed afterwards.  I highly recommend going here for therapeutic massage. 	My first foot and shoulder massage here and I had the therapist Ratsamee. She is so gentle yet skilled in her massage. I had a lot of tension from work but she massaged it all away. The price is also affordable and place is clean and nice. Thank you and hope to come again! 	Great service. So nice and accommodating. You start with a cold tea before your service. I got the office syndrome with oil. Just what I needed after the long plane ride. At the end she cracked my neck and back. Then you finish with a hot tea and yogurt. I'll definitely go back again before I leave. 	They served different types of tea (with benefits description) before and after the massage and also ended with a plate of salad. Masseuse was skilled and generally the crew were all super nice! Very pleasant experience! 	This place is amazing and a great service! I had foot scraping and pedicure. They did a fantastic job for make my feet looks natural and more glossy. I’m impressed with their professional works. Highly recommended! 	My fiancé and I came here for a herbal oil Thai massage. And in one word it was fantastic! Ja O was really attentive and expert at her craft. Will definitely come back soon! 	I recently had an aroma massage at Eszence, and it was nothing short of magical. It didn’t just soothe my body—it brought a deep sense of inner peace and healing. The care and hospitality I received were truly out of this world. I’m so grateful for the experience and already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Eszence, for such a soulful touch!🌼❤️ 	It was such a welcoming place and I felt so relaxed. The staff are super sweet and attentive.  Left feeling luxurious and pampered. They have used the space so efficiently. My 1st ever Thai massage and it really lived up to the name. Highly recommend this place. No wonder they have such good ratings. Hope to back the next time I visit Thailand. 	Had a very good aroma massage by senior therapist Ja-O! The massage was firm and so relaxing. I will come back again and again since they accept bookings on Whatsapp. Worth the price! 	This was the far best massage I've ever had in my ENTIRE life 🤯 K. Arty for me and my mom had Ice. They were not only thorough and so experienced but also nice and caring. We were both sooo satisfied and walked out with big smiles! Wish we found this place earlier so that we could visit twice 🥲 (and they were also very accommodating and understanding when I had to cancel for the first time due to the heavy traffic on the road!!) 	Me and my husband said the same idea about this massage experience, “it’s the best massage I’ve had ever!!”, I thought I tried so much in my life, but this experience was so wonderful, highly recommend…⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 	Professional staff, clean, and calm environment. Nui was an exceptional masseuse. Tea before, after, & a tasty salad after was icing on the cake :) I higly recommend this spa when in Sukhumvit, Bankok! 	For someone who goes to massages very often i can tell the difference between a good one and one that’s not really it. If you come for a relaxing massage, very much recommend. The staff is extremely friendly and you get a nice drink as a starter with included information what it’s good for. At the end you also recieve a nice tea with some fruit and yogurt. Hospitality 10/10. 	Very satisfying experience. Staff members are nice and friendly. My massage was very therapeutic! The massage lady knows well about what she's doing, even though she has almost killed me with the pain!!! 😆 But I feel like reborn now 🤣🤣🤣 … 	I had a great foot massage at Eszence Massage and Spa in Bangkok! The staff was very friendly and professional. The therapist did an amazing job, using the right pressure to make my feet feel relaxed and refreshed. The spa was clean and quiet, with soft music and a nice smell. It was a very relaxing experience. I will definitely come back again. Highly recommended!
