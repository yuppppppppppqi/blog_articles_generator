<strong><u>Therapist Ratsamee</u></strong> gave me the best foot massage ever. So gentle yet effective!
Their special tea service before and after makes the experience feel complete.
<strong><u>Foot scraping treatment</u></strong> left my feet looking brand new. Worth every baht.
Fell asleep during my foot massage. Woke up feeling completely rejuvenated.
<strong><u>K. Arty's pressure</u></strong> was perfect for my sore feet. Found my go-to place!
The fruit yogurt plate after massage is such a thoughtful touch. Delicious!
<strong><u>Swedish foot massage</u></strong> by Ok was incredible. She found every tension point.
Professional atmosphere with great attention to detail. Clean and calming.
Foot massage was good but the air conditioning was freezing cold.
A bit expensive compared to nearby places, though the quality is decent.
