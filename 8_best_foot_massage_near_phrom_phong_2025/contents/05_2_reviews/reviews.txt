<strong><u>Incredible foot massage</u></strong> that fixed my plantar fasciitis. Therapist had magic hands!
The staff surprised me with a birthday treat after my massage. So thoughtful!
<strong><u>Ms. Nee's technique</u></strong> was perfect â€“ strong enough to relieve tension without pain.
Peaceful ambiance with beautiful art gallery. Makes waiting for treatment enjoyable.
<strong><u>Best foot reflexology</u></strong> I've had in Bangkok. My jet lag disappeared completely!
Clean, elegant, and professional. The attention to detail here is impressive.
<strong><u>Thai Warrior massage</u></strong> was intense but exactly what my tired muscles needed.
Their herbal compress with foot massage combo left me feeling completely renewed.
Foot massage was good but overpriced for what you get. Many cheaper options nearby.
Nice place but had to wait 20 minutes past my appointment time.
