<strong><u>Peaceful atmosphere</u></strong> and skilled foot massage made my jetlag disappear completely.
Their calming music and clean space instantly put me at ease.
<strong><u>Masseuse P'Ya</u></strong> worked magic on my tired feet. Worth every baht!
Hot tea and dried fruits after the massage was a lovely finishing touch.
<strong><u>Perfect pressure</u></strong> throughout my foot reflexology session. Felt completely renewed after.
Found this place by chance and now I'm hooked. Best foot massage in Bangkok!
<strong><u>Aroma foot massage</u></strong> was heavenly. Like a mini-vacation for my feet.
Staff was friendly and accommodating. Made my sore feet feel brand new.
Had to wait 15 minutes despite my reservation. Slightly frustrating.
Massage technique was good but prices higher than similar places nearby.
