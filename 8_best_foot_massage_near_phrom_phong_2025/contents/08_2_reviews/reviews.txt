<strong><u>Therapist June</u></strong> relieved my foot pain instantly. Her technique was exceptional!
Their 50% off second service deal made our couples massage very affordable.
<strong><u>Foot massage</u></strong> was one of the best I've had. Perfect pressure and technique.
Clean, bright space with professional staff. Very impressed with overall experience.
<strong><u>Manao's foot reflexology</u></strong> helped my jet-lagged feet recover completely. Amazing!
They accept credit cards which is super convenient for travelers like me.
<strong><u>Noon's strong hands</u></strong> worked out every knot in my feet. Left feeling reborn!
The delicious tea served after my foot massage was a perfect final touch.
Good massage but therapist kept chatting with others. Hard to relax fully.
Foot massage was a bit hurried compared to others I've had nearby.
