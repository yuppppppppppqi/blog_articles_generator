The <strong><u>herbal compress treatment</u></strong> was divine! My back pain disappeared completely.
<strong><u>Masseuse Som</u></strong> found every knot in my shoulders. Will definitely return.
Peaceful atmosphere with minimal noise. Perfect escape from busy Bangkok streets.
They gifted me the herbal ball to use at home! Such a thoughtful touch.
<strong><u>Incredibly relaxing experience</u></strong>. Fell asleep during my two-hour aromatherapy session.
Clean facility and friendly staff. The sweet tea afterward was refreshing.
Their therapists adjust pressure perfectly for my low pain tolerance.
Just a five-minute walk from Phrom Phong BTS. So convenient!
No proper foot washing, just a wet cloth. Expected better for the price.
Had to climb narrow stairs to reach the massage rooms. Difficult with my knee problems.
