<strong><u>Ms. Tim's technique</u></strong> worked out every knot in my back. Pure bliss!
Their foot massage in the darkened room made me fall asleep instantly.
<strong><u>Worth every baht</u></strong> and more! Easily the best massage in Sukhumvit.
My neck pain completely disappeared after one session with Kaew.
Been coming here every Bangkok trip for three years. Never disappoints.
<strong><u>P'Pang's attention to detail</u></strong> made my first foot massage experience amazing.
Cozy, warm atmosphere with relaxing music and friendly staff.
The herbal tea afterward was the perfect end to my massage.
My therapist left twice during the massage. Slightly unprofessional.
Had to wait 30 minutes despite having a reservation. Otherwise good service.
