I’ve had my first Thai massage in here, 10 years ago and today again! It re-confirmed the quality and expertise the employees have and the owner wants to keep it up!  What a joy to be able to have again an excellent experience!  I can only recommend to go for a Thai massage or herbal compress massage or combine both, you won’t be disappointed!!  The owner surprised me with a gift, b/c I mentioned I visited her place 10 years ago and was so happy that I found it back 🙏🏻 	This Thai massage was an exceptional experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a thorough and revitalizing treatment. It’s an ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, leaving you refreshed and renewed. I can’t wait to return for another session! 	I spent my last day (and birthday) here for 3 hours and got the Deep Thai Tension Tame and facial. The massage changed my life and removed all the possible tension lingering in my body. Made me understand the idea "the body keeps score". 	It's ok if you just want a rub, and to rest the legs for an hour...  I personally wouldn't go the 2 hr 'special ' as it would be better spent outside the old town...  I've had Better technique from some of the street side places!  Also the 'free gift' for a Google review adds to the imbalance in actual reality...  For 300 baht an hour it could be worse, it could definitely be better though!  2.5 to 3 stars 	I had an amazing experience during my two-session head, neck, and foot massage! The service was outstanding—very professional, relaxing, and exactly what I needed. Plus, the price was fantastic. Highly recommend! 	Very nice massage place with reasonable price. Masseurs are professional and other staff are so friendly and helpful. Had a wonderful and relaxing time here. Greatly recommend 	I have lived in Thailand for a year. This is the best massage that I have had. I did the 2 hour massage with hot compress. It is so nice because they start with your feet, which relaxes your muscles all over your body, do the hot compress to relax your back muscles even more, then do the massage. You’re basically butter at the end :) 	The massage itself is pretty good, so we decided to come back again today and make a booking. We paid in advance and arranged our evening around the booking.  After coming back at our booked time, we were asked if we could wait an extra 20-30 mins because the people before us decided to extend their massage by 30 minutes.  We had other plans for the evening so we had to cancel and leave, but the fact our booking time and repeat business didn’t mean anything left a sour taste in our mouth.  They offered a 10% discount as an apology but we are leaving tomorrow so it’s not useful for us. Shame really, because it spoiled our previous experience. 	We had foot massage here. Excellent  massage. Very friendly, professional staff. 1 star less because the chairs for foot massage were not comfortable and the lighting in the foot massage area was not so pleasant. 	The best massage I have ever gotten. I was completely tight from all my flying in Asia and I was completely stretched out and rubber all that away. I will be coming back during my stay in Thailand. Cannot recommend enough 	I visited this place on the last day of my trip. After a massage, I was so recharged that I almost started the trip all over again.  C&R = Christiano & Ronaldo, Siuuuuuuu!!!!!! 	The environment is decent. I had green bean body scrub and aloe vera whole body massage. My therapist Aoi can communicate in simple English and her skill was awesome. Aoi was dedicated and concentrated on the key areas. A great massage experience. 	Very good Thai massage! I recommend this. When arriving you get water. If you want, you can take a shower before the massage. The massage itself is from very good quality. After the massage you get a thee. 	My husband and I have been trying different places and going for massage every day. This was the best one. We will make sure to come back again. We purchased the 2 hour - foot and full body massage for 690 baht special. Incredible!! 	We went to this lovely place during our stay in Chiang Mai, the two lovely masseuses were fantastic, so friendly and gave a great foot massage! Unfortunately didn’t catch their names. Very accommodating and relaxing place. 	We visited the C and R massage shop after search lots of blogs and we knew we made the best choice! Staff are nice and kind and the massage agents have a great skill! The shop provided us the upgraded package and it was really nice! 	I had a warm compress massage for neck, back shoulders. My therapist only rubbed my back , no shoulders or neck before putting the warm compress. And I say rub because there was no massage unfortunately.. I’ve been to many massage places but this one was disappointing.
