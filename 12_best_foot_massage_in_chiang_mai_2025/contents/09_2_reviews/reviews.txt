My <strong><u>best massage in Thailand</u></strong>! One hour of pure pleasure. Incredible service and touches.
Clean, serene, calm parlor. <strong><u>Body scrub was one of the best</u></strong> treatments I've had.
Comfortable, detailed foot massage. <strong><u>Worth the price</u></strong>, fully reclining sofa for recharge.
Tried Traditional Thai Massage, absolutely amazing! <strong><u>Relaxing and invigorating</u></strong>. Highly recommend!
Wonderful foot massage experience! <strong><u>Impeccable technique</u></strong>, perfect pressure. Felt refreshed and light.
My favourite spot! Staff are kind, listen to needs, treat problem areas. <strong><u>Great touch</u></strong>!
Very calming and relaxing from the moment you walk in. <strong><u>Lovely, professional staff</u></strong>.
Felt cosy and cared for. After traditional Thai massage, <strong><u>slept sweetly like a baby</u></strong>!
The massage was good, but perhaps a little pricier than similar quality places nearby.
It was relaxing, but the masseuse didn't seem to touch my spine area much.
