Beautiful spa and a Very professional and great massage. My boyfriend and I shared a room and got each a Thai massage with oil. The place is clean and has a real spa atmosphere, not just like some of the little massage places at the corner. They do a foot wash and scrub first and give you a tea after. The perfect start and end to the massage experience. 	Best massage and facial we have ever had! Me and my partner came for a detoxifying and uplifting back, neck and shoulder massage including a facial. They are very professional and look after you so well! Price is definitely worth it and would definitely come back! Thankyou so much 	An absolutely amazing experience at this fancy massage and spa in Chiang Mai! The ambiance was serene and luxurious, the staff were professional and attentive, and the treatments left me feeling completely rejuvenated. A perfect place to relax and unwind—highly recommended! 	It was one of the best massages I had in my life. What a luxury feel, the ambience is spot on, v clean and beautifully decorated reception. I'm impressed by the welcome of the staff. She introduced me to the menu and suggested the best massage for me after having a small chat. They present a form to fill for any symptoms of illness or any health related issue. Also, u have to write which body parts need more work and which one to avoid. The room was spacious and clean with the latest decor. The masseuse knew her job well. I was amazed that she got to know which parts were stiff without even asking, just by gentle massaging. Shower and tea with a cookie in the end. Total amount paid 1000 bhat for 90 mins. I totally recommend this place. 	Five stars spa! If I could I would give 6! Best massage in Thailand! I have to say I’ve done many massages in Thailand but this one was very professional. The women didn’t speak to each other, were very quiet and relaxing and respectful, they asked where it’s okay to touch and where not to. The couples room was so relaxing and comfortable and we could take a shower after the oil massage! I felt so relaxed and comfortable after. Thank you! Beautiful place and the staff was very nice and professional. You get hot tea and cookies at the end to chill out some more 	Excellent massage! My wife and I did it together and I asked for a really firm pressure and they delivered 💪  We both did the Thai massage with balm for 60 minutes. My masseuse was a lot stronger than she looked and would 100% do it again. You can find cheaper massages around the area, but would go here over others for the experience and service. A+! 	Amazing place, the massage was perfect! You can choose how strong you want it to be and the areas of the body to focus! We had a couple massage in private room, it's a bit more expensive than other places that you can find around the city, but it worth it, I recommend 100% 	It is my favorite place for a Thai massage so far. I tested another place but it was half way good and more extensive especially you want to have a strong massage. As a very active person I rather have good quality. My therapist Rain is a very friendly and kind person. She makes everything happen to make me feel welcomed. I will come back for third time for sure! 	Such a great experience. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxing, the staff is very friendly and before the massage you get a foot bath. The massage itself was amazing, I’ve never felt more relaxed before. Thank you so much 	It deserves more than 5 stars rating. Professional and good skill, definitely will come back again. Highly recommend the therapist Nikki for Traditional Thai massage. 	Nice, clean, spacious facility with reasonable prices.  However, my massage itself was quite poor, which I was surprised by given the stellar reviews. I ended up asking to stop a few minutes in. The front desk was very nice and gave me a new masseuse who was excellent, but they did charge me for 30 min for the first few minutes, in addition to the 60 min good massage.  Both friends I was with had good experiences. 	Very professional place, prices are higher than in the small shops but worth it. you fill out a form first with some health questions, massage intensity and spots which you would like to focus on or rather avoid. Foot wash and scrub with flowers and limes was really good.  My fiance and I had the thai massage with hot compress and it was a really nice expirience, I even fell asleep in the first half.  I have very stiff muscles which makes it hard for me to enjoy massages as I can be very sensitive to certain touches. Overall it was a nice expirience for me, but my issues remain mostly the same, but that's mostly on me. The therapists are very attentive and adjust their intensity when they see that you are in pain. 	I came here as a walk-in from the off-season. It's an atmosphere that makes the facility comfortable, nature-friendly, and calm. I received a tie massage for an hour, and the massage staff were very professional. I was more satisfied because I chose the parts I wanted to receive intensively. I feel refreshed. 	Service and massage are wonderful from beginning to end. Staff are welcoming and kind and offered us cold towels to freshen up from the heat outside.  Plus the ambience and feel of the lobby when you first walk in is delightful. Would highly recommend anyone staying in Chiang Mai to come here. One of the best spa and massage around here. Will be coming back here again next time. 	I cannot recommend this place enough! Super Friendly English speaking staff who are incredibly skilled at what they do. My friend and I purchased the duo 2hr massage package and it was incredibly affordable at $45pp. I will definitely be back. Thank you thank you!! 	Excellent place and great massage.  We have a 2 years old baby, they allow me for the baby to be sleeping in her stroller while I was getting a feet's massage (stroller in the same room) 	I had an amazing facial here!!! SUPER relaxing, included some massage too. The staff were all lovely, and they gave me a tea and a cookie at the end :)
