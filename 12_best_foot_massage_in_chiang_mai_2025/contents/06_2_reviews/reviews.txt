<strong><u>Amazing experience</u></strong>! Clean, calming, welcoming atmosphere. Masseuses truly outstanding and skilled.
60 min jet lag massage, never felt more refreshed! <strong><u>Small but mighty therapist</u></strong> got knots out.
Very good massage, calm atmosphere, kind people. <strong><u>Little offerings complete a beautiful experience</u></strong>!
Friendly, welcoming, pleasant atmosphere. Good foot & Thai massage. <strong><u>Recommended, will go again</u></strong>!
<strong><u>Worth every penny</u></strong>! Friendly staff, cool place. Tea and snacks were a lovely touch.
Small things made it fantastic! <strong><u>Super attentive and kind</u></strong>. Brilliant all-round experience!
Fantastic Thai Massage! <strong><u>Total relaxation guaranteed</u></strong>. Nicely decorated, super friendly staff.
Felt light and refreshed after 1hr Thai massage. <strong><u>Attentive staff knew all sore spots</u></strong>. 10/10!
Counter staff were lovely, but my massage therapist felt a bit rude, ignored my requests.
Felt rushed at the start, had to pay upfront. Noisy with traffic/staff talking.
