It was one of the worst massage ever. The lady that done my massage, I could tell she didn’t have any actual skills, but was just using force and it was everywhere, arms all over the show, she didn’t get any pressure points, I didn’t even allow her to crack my back and just done it myself (I know how to twist and crack my back neck etc myself) …. I did not trust her at all.  But I love that at the end there was a customers satisfactory questioner - I never like to complain here and to the business unless something is quite bad. Because this service was not okay - the lady needs to be taught proper ways of massage before doing it to every customer, it could cause damage.  I told the front desk lady (I’m guessing she was the manager.) I kindly explained to her - and said I was still happy to pay in full because the lady still done an hours massage. But she had given me a discount which was nice of her. I’m not saying that all The therapist  will be bad, because I’m sure some of the ladies they hired there will have a lot of experience, but it’s the business at fault to not train and test out every massage ladies skills 	It's the best. The price is great, too! I met the best massage mate of my life. 	Genuinely one of the best massages I’ve ever had! I went with the special that includes foot, neck, back and shoulders and it was heavenly. The facilities are very clean and neat and so relaxing, and the lady who was with me was very attentive and her pressure was perfect. I would highly recommend this place as it has a wide variety of treatments and I plan to try them all after this lovely experience 	Zen Sense Health Spa is pure relaxation! From the warm welcome to the skilled therapists, every detail is perfect. I had one of the best Thai massages—great technique, perfect pressure, and truly rejuvenating. The ambiance is peaceful making the experience even better. Highly recommend and will definitely return! 	A wonderfully peaceful and relaxing experience from the moment we entered right through to when we left. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing, very clean, and all the staff met us with a smile. We had a foot massage, and it was slightly more in price than nearby places, but it was worth it. Will happily come back next time I am in Chiang Mai. 	This massage parlor is the most satisfying one I've experienced so far. As I'll be staying in Chiang Mai for 30 days, finding a place to thoroughly relieve the fatigue from my journey is crucial. This establishment, open for approximately four months, offers exceptionally worthwhile promotional activities. More importantly, there's a massage therapist named Anna whose skills in oil pressure massage and foot massage are remarkably proficient. She is incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the entire massage session a relieving and relaxing experience for both mind and body. I highly recommend it to travelers interested in getting a massage! 	I go to thai massages in Germany regularly and have been going 10 of 14 days since I’ve been in Thailand. And this is the most professional and nicest place I’ve ever been. The service is awesome on top of that and it is so clean. 10/10 	Such an amazing spa! I did the aroma therapy essential oil massage and it was the best massage I’ve ever got! So relaxing, soothing and just all around great. I will be dreaming about this until the next time I’m in Chiang Mai! 	I’m surprised by the high rating of this place as my experience was just mediocre. Unlike other Thai massages I had in Chiang Mai, My masseuse keep repeating the same pattern over and over again for the same part and felt like there was a lack of technique. And communication wasn’t always smooth as well.  Another problem is that there were other guests talking out loud in the same room, which was not really this place’s problem but I think they should ask other guests to be quiet to ensure others to have a good experience. 	Amazing experience at this massage salon! Nan and Rean are incredible therapists who make you feel truly special, not just another customer. The place is spotless and beautifully decorated, creating a perfect atmosphere for relaxation. It exceeded all my expectations! 	The environment and the reception staff were great, but unfortunately, the massage experience was bad. My friends had a great experience, so I believe this was an issue with the particular therapist.  My friends and I purchased the same package(foot, neck, back, shoulder - 90mins), but the timing and procedures were not synchronized, which was quite confusing. The therapist got to the head area much quicker than both of my friends’ and spent an unusually long time there. Also, the therapist had poor control over the pressure - sometimes the pressure was so light it felt like no effort was being applied, and after I requested more pressure, it became overly intense. As a result, my neck now hurts so much whenever I move that I would rather not have had the massage at all. 	Phi gave me a wonderful Thai massage!! This spa is one of the nicest I’ve been to in Thailand. Beautiful and great service. Will be back next time I’m in Chiang Mai! 	I came here twice during my trip. The staff is so nice and adjusted pressure and service as requested. Highly recommend the foot massages and facial massage. 	Had a very relaxing massage. Head massage was really great. Very clean and calm atmosphere. Really love it! 🤍🥰 … 	Best body scrub, felt really great after. Would highly recommend. 	Very nice massage spot. I asked for a foot massage. It was beyond great. I fell asleep immediately. Thank you specifically to Nan, the best masseuse ever! 	Very happy with the service and quality of the massage. Lovely ambience and a professional attitude. If I’m Chiang Mai again I will not hesitate to return here. Competitive price too.
