They offer authentic Thai massages with customizable strength preferences. The environment is old-school, featuring beds and fans instead of air conditioning, which enhances the breathing experience during the massage for maximum relaxation.  Pin and Dada were fantastic masseuses, delivering a thorough and professional massage. After the session, tea and snacks were served, adding a nice touch to the experience. The price point is very affordable for a 2-hour massage, making it great value for money.  Easily reachable via Grab or by foot if you‚Äôre staying near the Tha Phae Gate area. Highly recommended for a true Thai massage experience! 	I visited here 3 days in a row - Thai massage, foot & leg massage, and sports massage.  All were amazing!  If you get the sports massage be prepared for some intense pressure, which I loved... But, many may consider it too strong.  The lady that seemed to be in charge spoke great English and was able to pass along my requests to the massage therapist.  I will definitely be back! 	Fantastic massage place and lovely staff. Honestly, this place is the best massage I've ever been in Chiang Mai. The oil massage felt like a deep tissue session, working out all the knots. Thai mass and foot massage  I left feeling relaxed and renewed.  Highly recommend! üíÜ Sometimes might be fully booked. Better calling ahead for a reservation. Well worth it! 	First time doing a massage here in Thailand üáπüá≠ and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed ü§© Karina Thai Massage had the sweetest ladies that massaged our back, neck, shoulders, and head. Very skilled with cracking our backs and a nice oil to make the massaging go very smoothly ü´∂üèº  We dropped in without an appointment and they were happy to receive us at 8PM!  The ladies chatted a little amongst themselves and also with us. It sounded like they had lots of fun doing their job ‚ô°üíï  The prices are also very good! For one hour, this specific massage was 350 baht. The towels and massage bench are very clean, and you get a refreshing water to drink at the end.  Thank you so much for having us Karina Thai massage, we wish we stayed longer in Chiang Mai to visit you more often! Until next time ‚ô° 	Fantastic massage place. A small place with four massage tables. This allows the owner to carefully select who works there. I must honestly say, this was the best massage I've gotten in Chiang Mai (yes I've tried all the over hyped places like the blind massage, the prisoner massage, etc - those places don't even come close). The oil massage was similar to a deep tissue massage and all the knots were patiently worked out. After, i felt like new.  I would recommend calling for a reservation ahead of time. Well worth it. Highly recommend this place. 	Absolutely outstanding place to experience a perfect thai massage!!! More than competent staff, charming and very clean location, truly the best place I'm aware of to enjoy a professional massagel treatment. A "must be" for sure when travelling to Chiang Mai next time, Karina Thai Massage being even another good reason to come back to this wonderful city. 	Sports Massage // 2hrs  Small, but clean and quaint shop, with great attention to atmosphere and detail‚Äîthe bed linens were taut and cutely decorated.  I've been having some lower back aches and mobility issues from training hard for adventure sports, and the session was really comprehensive in orientation towards improving mobility.  The therapist was clearly knowledgeable and experienced, important for the deep tissue work required in a sports massage.  After the session was over, I was treated to tea and cookies. A thoughtful touch! 	The best massage I've ever had. I picked deep tissue massage as needed work on my painful knotted muscles. The young lady called Lat was just amazing. Very strong, but very attentive same time. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and highly recommend this place if you want a good quality massage. 	This place is special.  Top notch experienced skills in massage with sensitivity.  I felt an exceptional level of positive energy.  Very clean and thoughtful touches everywhere from massage table to a cup of tea.  Highly recommended.  Simply the best! 	I had a old injury to my elbow and arm which needed some deep work. I went to Karina for her deep tissue massage after seeing another review from a customer. Karina was amazing!! Definitely worth going if you are looking for a good massage therapist. I am a massage therapist myself and always find it difficult finding someone who understands what your body needs. It also helps as Karina‚Äôs English is very good. I would go regularly if I lived in Chang Mai. Karina will not disappoint! 	Nai was in charge this morning and I had a great aroma massage. She was very attentive to my health issues and gave me the best massage so far. I already booked the next one with her in a few days üòä I totally recommend the place, everyone is professional (I had previously a massage with Lucksamee, she's very good too) and  so nice, and Karina is great. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town 	100% recommend. Maybe the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. The masseuses were professional, knowledgeable, and kind! And very affordable price. 	Had the pleasure of getting a massage from Karina today. I am a physician and recently had shoulder surgery.Karina worked with me for two hours. She clearly knows her technique and her passion for helping people was obvious! Only regret was not finding her sooner in my stay in Chiangmai, she is a level above most here. Highly recommend! 	1st experience the sheer delight of a rejuvenating foot massage at this exquisite spot! My visit here left me in awe as I indulged in a truly relaxing massage. But that's not all ‚Äì the highlight of my day was getting to know the charming ladyboss, Karina. Her warm hospitality and vast knowledge about Chiang Mai's hidden gems, especially during the enchanting winter season, made my experience even more fulfilling.  Karina's professionalism shines through, and she genuinely cares about her guests' well-being. Her skilled hands work wonders, leaving you feeling invigorated and refreshed after the massage. This is the place to unwind after a long journey or a bustling day in Chiang Mai.  2nd visit I still had the pleasure of experiencing Karina's exceptional foot massage skills, and it was truly remarkable. She displayed a deep understanding of muscle and nerve points, which was especially helpful in alleviating the soreness in my legs from rigorous physical training. What added to the unique experience was Karina introducing me to their Thai massage with her signature staff, Koi. I must say that Koi delivered one of the best Thai massages I've ever had. Overall, my second visit was nothing short of fantastic, thanks to Karina and Koi's expertise and their commitment to providing a top-notch experience. 	Amazing Massage! They called more staff to cater for the 3 of us. It was the first time getting a Massage from a man, so I was a bit worried, but Kong (not sure if I got his name right) was a true professional, it was truly one of the best Massages I have ever had!! Also sooo friendly people! Loved it so much, felt super relaxed afterwards, thank you so much! üíû 	100% recommend this place! I have a back condition, and am usually in a lot of pain. They understood it well, and handled it effectively, but calmly. 	Karina was one of the loveliest people I've met in Thailand - cares so much about getting all the knots out and that you have a great experience. Absolutely recommend the neck back and head massage if you have a tight neck/back. Wish I had longer in Chiang Mai so I could come back again!
