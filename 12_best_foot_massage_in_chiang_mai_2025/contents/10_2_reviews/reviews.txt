<strong><u>Pin and Dada</u></strong> were fantastic masseuses! Thorough, professional, great value for money.
Visited 3 days straight! Thai, foot, sports massage - all amazing. <strong><u>Loved the intense pressure</u></strong>!
Best massage in Chiang Mai! Oil massage felt like <strong><u>deep tissue, worked out all knots</u></strong>.
Sweetest ladies, skilled back cracking! <strong><u>Very good prices</u></strong>, clean bench, refreshing water.
Honestly, best massage here. <strong><u>Worked out knots patiently</u></strong>, felt like new. Highly recommend!
Outstanding place for perfect Thai massage! <strong><u>Competent staff, charming, clean location</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Lat</u></strong> was amazing! Very strong, attentive. Thoroughly enjoyed the deep tissue experience.
This place is special. <strong><u>Top notch skills with sensitivity</u></strong>. Exceptional positive energy. Simply best!
Sports massage pressure was intense, maybe too strong for some but perfect for my needs.
The therapists chatted amongst themselves during the massage, which was a little distracting.
