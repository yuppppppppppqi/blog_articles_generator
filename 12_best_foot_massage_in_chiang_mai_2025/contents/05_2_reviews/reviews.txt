<strong><u>Wonderful experience</u></strong>! Amazing skills and technique. Quality unbeatable for the friendlier price.
By far the best near our hotel. <strong><u>Beauty and Tintin were THE BEST</u></strong>! Clean, professional.
Best foot and neck/shoulder massage in 4 months! <strong><u>Perfect intensity</u></strong>, got all knots out!
<strong><u>Lala did wonders</u></strong> for my lower back! Left feeling reborn. Mindful, kind, consistent.
<strong><u>Dao's skills were very, very good</u></strong>. Entertained all requests, deep tissue greatly improved shoulder.
High quality services, low prices. <strong><u>My favorite</u></strong> in Chiang Mai, worth any wait!
Best Thai massage here! Clean, friendly, professional staff. <strong><u>Knew what they were doing</u></strong>!
<strong><u>Excellent deep tissue</u></strong>! Therapist targeted sensitive parts with care and enormous skill. Perfect stretches.
The oil massage was relaxing, but maybe not as hard/deep as I prefer sometimes.
It's good, but wish they had some relaxing music and maybe a nicer smell.
