<strong><u>Pim</u></strong> gave the best massage I received in Thailand! Willing to revisit. ðŸ˜€
Resolved my shoulder/back pain completely after 60 min Thai massage. <strong><u>Absolutely impressed</u></strong>!
Dedicated rooms with real tables! Masseuse used <strong><u>good, strong pressure</u></strong> and focused where asked.
Most relaxing massage, we both dozed off! <strong><u>Shower facility was so convenient</u></strong> before flight.
Best foot massage ever! <strong><u>Perfect pressure</u></strong> and a nice scrub beforehand. Would recommend.
<strong><u>Laa and Benz</u></strong> were wonderful, warm, hospitable. Taught us Thai words! Excellent experience.
Massages are amazing and <strong><u>great value</u></strong>. Foot scrub, tea, rice cakes are lovely touches.
Felt rejuvenated, energy flowing again! <strong><u>Women were so kind</u></strong>, ambiance is great. Loved it!
Masseuses were chatting for the first 10 mins during our couples massage, a bit distracting.
Massage tables are quite hard, typical for Thailand but less comfortable than US ones.
