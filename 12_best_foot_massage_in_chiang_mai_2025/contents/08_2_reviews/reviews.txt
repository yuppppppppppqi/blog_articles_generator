Best massage in Thailand! 2hr hot compress massage was incredible. <strong><u>Left feeling like butter</u></strong> :)
My therapist <strong><u>Aoi</u></strong> was awesome! Dedicated, concentrated on key areas. Great experience.
Best massage ever! Stretched out and rubbery after flying. <strong><u>Cannot recommend enough</u></strong>!
It was okay, just a basic rub. Better technique found elsewhere for the price.
The foot massage chairs weren't very comfortable, and the lighting was a bit harsh.
