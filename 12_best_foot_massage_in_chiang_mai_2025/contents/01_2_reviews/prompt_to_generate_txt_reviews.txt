From the moment you enter, you are welcomed with warmth and a positive atmosphere. The staff, along with everyone inside, is incredibly hospitable and professional.  During our visit, an earthquake occurred in Thailand. The staff politely advised us to return the next day for safety reasons and even issued a card for our rescheduled appointment. Their communication was excellent throughout the process.  When we visited the next day, they promptly guided us to our massage session within minutes.  I highly recommend making an appointment before your visit for a seamless experience. 	I had a great experience at the spa! Booking through Klook was easy, and my reservation was smooth. The place was clean, smelled wonderful, and had a welcoming atmosphere. They served a refreshing welcome drink and offered tea and rice crackers afterward. The aroma oil massage was soothing and relaxing, and I left feeling rejuvenated. The staff were also friendly and attentive. I would definitely visit again! 	Best thai massage I’ve had in Chiang mai. Perfect way to end your trip. Place was so clean. Quiet. Customer service was also great. You can message their facebook page and reserve your slot easily. 	This place never disappoints! Today I got a body scrub, a treatment, and an oil massage with P’Kate. I’m super impressed—her massage was amazing, totally thorough from head to toe. I’ll definitely keep coming back! 	A very clean and welcoming massage spa A very safe environment and all staff were very professional. My masseuse was Ket and I had a full body massage and foot massage with Thai balm. Finished with a cup of traditional tea and a biscuit. I would really recommend 👌. … 	Amazing experience here at Relax Express! My partner and I did a package number 2 that included a foot massage + back neck and shoulders massage. I was blown away by the treatment. We started with a foot wash then went to the treatment room where I was transformed. My therapist took special care and her movements were intuitive to my needs. We walked in with no appointment and were taken care of immediately and offered a tea to drink while we waited. I highly recommend stopping in! Thank you to the amazing and professional staff 🙏🏼❤️ 	It was the best massage I received in Chiang Mai. I had the Thai + foot massage menu, great price to the great massage. Nuan(hopefully i spelled it right) was my masseuse, she was very professional and friendly. She noticed my sore spots and spent extra time on those spots. I felt so relaxed after the massage. 	A very soothing place with great therapists Before the massage there is honey tea which is very nice  After massage there's room temperature jasmine tea 5 stars will come again👌👌👌👌	This place is fabulous! My masseuse took away all the tension that I held for weeks in my body. Probably the best massage I have ever had. 	Had a Thai Massage. As someone with a really stiff body it was wonderful. They clean your feet before starting, and give you hot tea before and after the massage. Also clean clothes to switch into. Everything is nice and clean here. Very relaxing! Would come back :) 	It was such a relaxing experience, just what I needed after a long day of hopping from one market to another. The spa is super clean and love the hospitality they provide from start until end. 	Can’t recommend their Thai massage enough. You can feel the mettā coming through their practice. One of their therapists, Lar, worked her magic for 1.5 hours and I’m grateful for her effort. Can’t get more authentic — love the atmosphere too. 	I had a very pleasant experience. The body scrub was thorough and left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The hot oil massage was well-executed, with just the right amount of pressure. My masseuse was professional, attentive, and ensured I was comfortable throughout the session. The environment was clean and calming. I would definitely recommend their services. 	Such a good experience. I got a foot massage  and it was strong and really felt like the masseuse knew her craft (not always so with some massage places!). She threw in a little head and shoulder massage at the end which turned out to be exactly what I needed. Amazing! The massage place itself is calming and clean. It is well organized and I felt very comfortable with the whole process. 	The massage was very pleasant. Whole place is very clean and nicely put together. You get the welcome drink and hot tea after the massage. 	Very nice place, quite realizing atmosphere, pleasant music. It was amazing experience, Thai massage and relaxing feet massage in the end. Really recommend ❤️ 	Most magical time at the relax express spa, the ladies did an amazing job, will definitely return, would recommend to anyone.
