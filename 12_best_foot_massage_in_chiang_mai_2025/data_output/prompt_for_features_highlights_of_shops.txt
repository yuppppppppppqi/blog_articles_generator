From the moment you enter, you are welcomed with warmth and a positive atmosphere. The staff, along with everyone inside, is incredibly hospitable and professional.  During our visit, an earthquake occurred in Thailand. The staff politely advised us to return the next day for safety reasons and even issued a card for our rescheduled appointment. Their communication was excellent throughout the process.  When we visited the next day, they promptly guided us to our massage session within minutes.  I highly recommend making an appointment before your visit for a seamless experience. 	I had a great experience at the spa! Booking through Klook was easy, and my reservation was smooth. The place was clean, smelled wonderful, and had a welcoming atmosphere. They served a refreshing welcome drink and offered tea and rice crackers afterward. The aroma oil massage was soothing and relaxing, and I left feeling rejuvenated. The staff were also friendly and attentive. I would definitely visit again! 	Best thai massage I‚Äôve had in Chiang mai. Perfect way to end your trip. Place was so clean. Quiet. Customer service was also great. You can message their facebook page and reserve your slot easily. 	This place never disappoints! Today I got a body scrub, a treatment, and an oil massage with P‚ÄôKate. I‚Äôm super impressed‚Äîher massage was amazing, totally thorough from head to toe. I‚Äôll definitely keep coming back! 	A very clean and welcoming massage spa A very safe environment and all staff were very professional. My masseuse was Ket and I had a full body massage and foot massage with Thai balm. Finished with a cup of traditional tea and a biscuit. I would really recommend üëå. ‚Ä¶ 	Amazing experience here at Relax Express! My partner and I did a package number 2 that included a foot massage + back neck and shoulders massage. I was blown away by the treatment. We started with a foot wash then went to the treatment room where I was transformed. My therapist took special care and her movements were intuitive to my needs. We walked in with no appointment and were taken care of immediately and offered a tea to drink while we waited. I highly recommend stopping in! Thank you to the amazing and professional staff üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è 	It was the best massage I received in Chiang Mai. I had the Thai + foot massage menu, great price to the great massage. Nuan(hopefully i spelled it right) was my masseuse, she was very professional and friendly. She noticed my sore spots and spent extra time on those spots. I felt so relaxed after the massage. 	A very soothing place with great therapists Before the massage there is honey tea which is very nice  After massage there's room temperature jasmine tea 5 stars will come againüëåüëåüëåüëå	This place is fabulous! My masseuse took away all the tension that I held for weeks in my body. Probably the best massage I have ever had. 	Had a Thai Massage. As someone with a really stiff body it was wonderful. They clean your feet before starting, and give you hot tea before and after the massage. Also clean clothes to switch into. Everything is nice and clean here. Very relaxing! Would come back :) 	It was such a relaxing experience, just what I needed after a long day of hopping from one market to another. The spa is super clean and love the hospitality they provide from start until end. 	Can‚Äôt recommend their Thai massage enough. You can feel the mettƒÅ coming through their practice. One of their therapists, Lar, worked her magic for 1.5 hours and I‚Äôm grateful for her effort. Can‚Äôt get more authentic ‚Äî love the atmosphere too. 	I had a very pleasant experience. The body scrub was thorough and left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The hot oil massage was well-executed, with just the right amount of pressure. My masseuse was professional, attentive, and ensured I was comfortable throughout the session. The environment was clean and calming. I would definitely recommend their services. 	Such a good experience. I got a foot massage  and it was strong and really felt like the masseuse knew her craft (not always so with some massage places!). She threw in a little head and shoulder massage at the end which turned out to be exactly what I needed. Amazing! The massage place itself is calming and clean. It is well organized and I felt very comfortable with the whole process. 	The massage was very pleasant. Whole place is very clean and nicely put together. You get the welcome drink and hot tea after the massage. 	Very nice place, quite realizing atmosphere, pleasant music. It was amazing experience, Thai massage and relaxing feet massage in the end. Really recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è 	Most magical time at the relax express spa, the ladies did an amazing job, will definitely return, would recommend to anyone.

It was one of the worst massage ever. The lady that done my massage, I could tell she didn‚Äôt have any actual skills, but was just using force and it was everywhere, arms all over the show, she didn‚Äôt get any pressure points, I didn‚Äôt even allow her to crack my back and just done it myself (I know how to twist and crack my back neck etc myself) ‚Ä¶. I did not trust her at all.  But I love that at the end there was a customers satisfactory questioner - I never like to complain here and to the business unless something is quite bad. Because this service was not okay - the lady needs to be taught proper ways of massage before doing it to every customer, it could cause damage.  I told the front desk lady (I‚Äôm guessing she was the manager.) I kindly explained to her - and said I was still happy to pay in full because the lady still done an hours massage. But she had given me a discount which was nice of her. I‚Äôm not saying that all The therapist  will be bad, because I‚Äôm sure some of the ladies they hired there will have a lot of experience, but it‚Äôs the business at fault to not train and test out every massage ladies skills 	It's the best. The price is great, too! I met the best massage mate of my life. 	Genuinely one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had! I went with the special that includes foot, neck, back and shoulders and it was heavenly. The facilities are very clean and neat and so relaxing, and the lady who was with me was very attentive and her pressure was perfect. I would highly recommend this place as it has a wide variety of treatments and I plan to try them all after this lovely experience 	Zen Sense Health Spa is pure relaxation! From the warm welcome to the skilled therapists, every detail is perfect. I had one of the best Thai massages‚Äîgreat technique, perfect pressure, and truly rejuvenating. The ambiance is peaceful making the experience even better. Highly recommend and will definitely return! 	A wonderfully peaceful and relaxing experience from the moment we entered right through to when we left. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing, very clean, and all the staff met us with a smile. We had a foot massage, and it was slightly more in price than nearby places, but it was worth it. Will happily come back next time I am in Chiang Mai. 	This massage parlor is the most satisfying one I've experienced so far. As I'll be staying in Chiang Mai for 30 days, finding a place to thoroughly relieve the fatigue from my journey is crucial. This establishment, open for approximately four months, offers exceptionally worthwhile promotional activities. More importantly, there's a massage therapist named Anna whose skills in oil pressure massage and foot massage are remarkably proficient. She is incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the entire massage session a relieving and relaxing experience for both mind and body. I highly recommend it to travelers interested in getting a massage! 	I go to thai massages in Germany regularly and have been going 10 of 14 days since I‚Äôve been in Thailand. And this is the most professional and nicest place I‚Äôve ever been. The service is awesome on top of that and it is so clean. 10/10 	Such an amazing spa! I did the aroma therapy essential oil massage and it was the best massage I‚Äôve ever got! So relaxing, soothing and just all around great. I will be dreaming about this until the next time I‚Äôm in Chiang Mai! 	I‚Äôm surprised by the high rating of this place as my experience was just mediocre. Unlike other Thai massages I had in Chiang Mai, My masseuse keep repeating the same pattern over and over again for the same part and felt like there was a lack of technique. And communication wasn‚Äôt always smooth as well.  Another problem is that there were other guests talking out loud in the same room, which was not really this place‚Äôs problem but I think they should ask other guests to be quiet to ensure others to have a good experience. 	Amazing experience at this massage salon! Nan and Rean are incredible therapists who make you feel truly special, not just another customer. The place is spotless and beautifully decorated, creating a perfect atmosphere for relaxation. It exceeded all my expectations! 	The environment and the reception staff were great, but unfortunately, the massage experience was bad. My friends had a great experience, so I believe this was an issue with the particular therapist.  My friends and I purchased the same package(foot, neck, back, shoulder - 90mins), but the timing and procedures were not synchronized, which was quite confusing. The therapist got to the head area much quicker than both of my friends‚Äô and spent an unusually long time there. Also, the therapist had poor control over the pressure - sometimes the pressure was so light it felt like no effort was being applied, and after I requested more pressure, it became overly intense. As a result, my neck now hurts so much whenever I move that I would rather not have had the massage at all. 	Phi gave me a wonderful Thai massage!! This spa is one of the nicest I‚Äôve been to in Thailand. Beautiful and great service. Will be back next time I‚Äôm in Chiang Mai! 	I came here twice during my trip. The staff is so nice and adjusted pressure and service as requested. Highly recommend the foot massages and facial massage. 	Had a very relaxing massage. Head massage was really great. Very clean and calm atmosphere. Really love it! ü§çü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	Best body scrub, felt really great after. Would highly recommend. 	Very nice massage spot. I asked for a foot massage. It was beyond great. I fell asleep immediately. Thank you specifically to Nan, the best masseuse ever! 	Very happy with the service and quality of the massage. Lovely ambience and a professional attitude. If I‚Äôm Chiang Mai again I will not hesitate to return here. Competitive price too.

Beautiful spa and a Very professional and great massage. My boyfriend and I shared a room and got each a Thai massage with oil. The place is clean and has a real spa atmosphere, not just like some of the little massage places at the corner. They do a foot wash and scrub first and give you a tea after. The perfect start and end to the massage experience. 	Best massage and facial we have ever had! Me and my partner came for a detoxifying and uplifting back, neck and shoulder massage including a facial. They are very professional and look after you so well! Price is definitely worth it and would definitely come back! Thankyou so much 	An absolutely amazing experience at this fancy massage and spa in Chiang Mai! The ambiance was serene and luxurious, the staff were professional and attentive, and the treatments left me feeling completely rejuvenated. A perfect place to relax and unwind‚Äîhighly recommended! 	It was one of the best massages I had in my life. What a luxury feel, the ambience is spot on, v clean and beautifully decorated reception. I'm impressed by the welcome of the staff. She introduced me to the menu and suggested the best massage for me after having a small chat. They present a form to fill for any symptoms of illness or any health related issue. Also, u have to write which body parts need more work and which one to avoid. The room was spacious and clean with the latest decor. The masseuse knew her job well. I was amazed that she got to know which parts were stiff without even asking, just by gentle massaging. Shower and tea with a cookie in the end. Total amount paid 1000 bhat for 90 mins. I totally recommend this place. 	Five stars spa! If I could I would give 6! Best massage in Thailand! I have to say I‚Äôve done many massages in Thailand but this one was very professional. The women didn‚Äôt speak to each other, were very quiet and relaxing and respectful, they asked where it‚Äôs okay to touch and where not to. The couples room was so relaxing and comfortable and we could take a shower after the oil massage! I felt so relaxed and comfortable after. Thank you! Beautiful place and the staff was very nice and professional. You get hot tea and cookies at the end to chill out some more 	Excellent massage! My wife and I did it together and I asked for a really firm pressure and they delivered üí™  We both did the Thai massage with balm for 60 minutes. My masseuse was a lot stronger than she looked and would 100% do it again. You can find cheaper massages around the area, but would go here over others for the experience and service. A+! 	Amazing place, the massage was perfect! You can choose how strong you want it to be and the areas of the body to focus! We had a couple massage in private room, it's a bit more expensive than other places that you can find around the city, but it worth it, I recommend 100% 	It is my favorite place for a Thai massage so far. I tested another place but it was half way good and more extensive especially you want to have a strong massage. As a very active person I rather have good quality. My therapist Rain is a very friendly and kind person. She makes everything happen to make me feel welcomed. I will come back for third time for sure! 	Such a great experience. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxing, the staff is very friendly and before the massage you get a foot bath. The massage itself was amazing, I‚Äôve never felt more relaxed before. Thank you so much 	It deserves more than 5 stars rating. Professional and good skill, definitely will come back again. Highly recommend the therapist Nikki for Traditional Thai massage. 	Nice, clean, spacious facility with reasonable prices.  However, my massage itself was quite poor, which I was surprised by given the stellar reviews. I ended up asking to stop a few minutes in. The front desk was very nice and gave me a new masseuse who was excellent, but they did charge me for 30 min for the first few minutes, in addition to the 60 min good massage.  Both friends I was with had good experiences. 	Very professional place, prices are higher than in the small shops but worth it. you fill out a form first with some health questions, massage intensity and spots which you would like to focus on or rather avoid. Foot wash and scrub with flowers and limes was really good.  My fiance and I had the thai massage with hot compress and it was a really nice expirience, I even fell asleep in the first half.  I have very stiff muscles which makes it hard for me to enjoy massages as I can be very sensitive to certain touches. Overall it was a nice expirience for me, but my issues remain mostly the same, but that's mostly on me. The therapists are very attentive and adjust their intensity when they see that you are in pain. 	I came here as a walk-in from the off-season. It's an atmosphere that makes the facility comfortable, nature-friendly, and calm. I received a tie massage for an hour, and the massage staff were very professional. I was more satisfied because I chose the parts I wanted to receive intensively. I feel refreshed. 	Service and massage are wonderful from beginning to end. Staff are welcoming and kind and offered us cold towels to freshen up from the heat outside.  Plus the ambience and feel of the lobby when you first walk in is delightful. Would highly recommend anyone staying in Chiang Mai to come here. One of the best spa and massage around here. Will be coming back here again next time. 	I cannot recommend this place enough! Super Friendly English speaking staff who are incredibly skilled at what they do. My friend and I purchased the duo 2hr massage package and it was incredibly affordable at $45pp. I will definitely be back. Thank you thank you!! 	Excellent place and great massage.  We have a 2 years old baby, they allow me for the baby to be sleeping in her stroller while I was getting a feet's massage (stroller in the same room) 	I had an amazing facial here!!! SUPER relaxing, included some massage too. The staff were all lovely, and they gave me a tea and a cookie at the end :)

If you get tired from shopping, you must come here to relax. They offer massages of different durations ranging from 1 to 4 hours. They even have colorful menus in three languages, which is very considerate! As shown in the picture, you can freely choose the massage style you like. My friend and I got relaxed here. We will definitely come again if we have the chance! 	I found this place online, and the environment is clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly, and the massage was both relaxing and had just the right amount of pressure. I also had a foot injury, and the staff thoughtfully applied medicine for me, which was really heartwarming. The service here is excellent, and I highly recommend it. After the massage, they even provided fruit and ginger tea to enjoy. 	I walked in without a reservation, and the receptionist assured me that he could arrange something within 15 minutes. True to his word, the session was ready to start in exactly 10 minutes‚Äîmuch more convenient than other spas that require advance booking.  The environment and service were both excellent, with the massage quality meeting high standards. A special highlight was the complimentary fruit after the session‚Äîit was incredibly sweet. Plus, the location is easy to find, right near the night market. Definitely worth recommending! 	I just had the most incredible one-hour massage experience! From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel completely at ease. They even provided refreshing drinks to enjoy throughout the session. The massage itself was deeply relaxing, leaving me feeling completely rejuvenated and at peace. It was such a unique and soothing experience that I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more. Thank you! 	I just had the strongest Thai massage of my life at Siamdara! I was actually planning to go to Zabai, but it was closed for Songkran, so I ended up here‚Äîand I‚Äôm so glad I did. The environment was soothing and relaxing, and they took the time to ask about my preferences via a questionnaire before starting. I requested a strong massage, and I didn‚Äôt have to keep asking for more pressure‚Äîthe masseur (named Male) delivered perfectly. If you‚Äôre looking for serious tension release and a personalized experience, this is the place. 	One of the best massages I‚Äôve had in Thailand for months! I had the 2 hour back, neck and shoulder and asked for a hard pressure to focus on my traps. The therapist did that and more, it was fab and I felt great at the end. Highly recommend and will be going back next time I‚Äôm in Chiang Mai. The service at reception was great as well, a drink on arrival and after the massage plus fresh fruit. The whole experience was wonderful ‚ò∫Ô∏è 	The staff here is so nice and friendly, and the massage is great too. Btw, love the fresh fruits after massage. Highly recommend!! 	Professional, warmth & friendly staff. Thai massage with hot press for 2 hours. Fantastic experience. Very relaxing and help my muscles heal after 2 weeks of long drives around Thailand. In Chiang Mai, will come again. Highly recommended. 	Very nice massage! They used tiger balm before the massage and it really helped relax! The location is good and the staff are all very nice, highly recommended! 	Very clean, very nice service. Hibiscus tea before the treatment and ginger tea with fruits at the end:) 	Great massage, perfect for those who like to choose their massage strength. Nice and polite staff! 	Good environment. Massage skill is good and comfortable. Good experience overall 	Everything was super nice! We walked in and got a spot for a couple‚Äôs massage straight away. Before the massage they gave us an iced drink and scrubbed our feet. After the massage we were goven ginger honey tea and some fresh fruit. The people working were very nice and attentive. I definetly recommend! Good value for the price! 	I have enjoyed the two-hour full body massage (there is promo, 750baht). The staffs are nice and the atmosphere is good. Overall, good massage experience here! :) 	Very good experience here. The shop is clean and the staff are professional. They provide you with drinks and fruit which is a nice touch. Went for the medium strength back and shoulder massage and it was pretty strong at certain points. Overall had a lovely time here. 	amazing..! perfect massage, kind workers I want to come again 	First time having Thai massage. It was 2 hours for 750 baht. Super accommodating. Make sure to book appointment as they can get busy. Gives tea and fruits.

I came here together with my friends, and we both are amazed by the skills and technique of the masseuse. We both tried oil massage and dare to say it was one of the best experience we had in chiang mai. The price is friendlier than in old town, but the quality is unbeatable. Everyone is welcoming and kind. I would love to be back again. 	We tried several massage places near our hotel and this was by far the best. We tried Aiyaret and it was just average, even though it's got great reviews. Kunlarat was an instant success - went for the Thai full body 60 minutes and it was SO good. Shivers down the spine! The parlour is basic inside but clean and professional.  We went back three more times and had different massages including reflexology and they were all great. Masseuses called Beauty and Tintin were THE BEST and we asked for them specifically each time. Oh and there's a very nice cat that occasionally comes out of the back room to see what's going on üòª 	Had the best foot massage and the best neck/shoulder/back massage I have had so far after 4 months in Asia. Perfect intensity and got all my shoulder knots out ! Absolutely 10/10 for both massages! Lovely clean environment with enthusiastic and very talented staff! Definitely go here ! üíõ :) xxx 	Visited this spot twice because I enjoyed it so much! Lala did wonders for my lower back issues, I left feeling reborn. I appreciated how she really took time to focus on the areas I mentioned. Mindful, kind and consistent experience! 	I tried this massage shop two days ago and I found the staff ( Manager - Bee in black and the owner in green)  all are very nice. As I am a very demanding person, I chatted with the Bee that I looked the best Masseur here. Bee introduced Dao (a young Thai girl in red as shown in the picture below) to me, and I have a 2-hour oil massage. Dao entertained all my requests, including the deep tissue massage for my right upper hand and shoulder. Her skills were very, very good. After having the oil massage for consecutive 2 days, I could feel my upper hand and shoulder were greatly improved. Although there is no pricey decoration, they have a warm atmosphere and good massage skills. 	I have been through many message shops in Chiangmai, Kunlarat is my favorite. The services are high quality and the prices are low. I always come to this shop when I am in changklan road. Sometimes I forgot to make a reservation, I have to wait for a little bit, but the good service worth the waiting. 	The best massage in Thailand so far. Very cozy and clean space. Very nice therapist. We will be back! ‚ù§Ô∏è 	I had the BEST Thai massage here! The Place was so clean. Staff were so friendly and professional. They totally knew what they were doing. Needless to say i came back for an oil Massage and then at another time for a foot Massage. Maybe I‚Äôll come back again today;) I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more. Made for a most memorable first visit for me here in Chiang Mai! 	The service was really good. The workers were kind and attentive. They provide water and help you if needed. The actual massage itself was great; they loosened my foot, stretched it gently and everything was relaxing & calm. They ended the massage with loosening my neck and back. This was just the foot massage, but there were other options. 	I've been here daily for two weeks. I've gotten to know the team and owner, they are incredibly kind.  The massages are consistently great and I can't recommend it enough :) 	One hour Full Body oil massage. It was really relaxing, not as hard as other massage places might be but perfect for pain relief and relaxation. Can recommend. (Music and a nice smell would be great) 	Very professional and clean. Excellent services are offered by the staff. It can be hard to get deep tissue in Thailand but this place comes to the rescue. Their massage services can fill up fast because they are good (and everyone knows it!) so you may want to book in advance. Thank you for taking care of us and keep up the amazing work! Can't wait to see you again! 	I experienced 4 massage places in Chiang mai, this place is the best one! She did it really carefully, effectively, all my pain is relieved! love it and will comeback when having chance 	Excellent service!!! I googled Ashiatsu Massage, and it brought up their business and it wasn‚Äôt on their menu. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm butchering her name, but Zak Zdah was EXCELLENT!!! Using her body weight to hit the pressure points in my calves ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞  If I were in Chiang Mai / Thailand longer I would go again‚Ä¶ üî•üî•üî• 	In need of deep tissue massage I was recommended to try Kunlarat. The service was excellent - very professional but also very personal. My therapist targeted the more sensitive parts of my body very caring and with enormous skill. The stretches at the end of the massage felt more individual than in a traditional Thai massage and suited me perfectly. Thanks - Just booked another session. 	There are a lot of massage places to choose from and cannot recommend this one enough! I went here everyday of my trip to Chiang Mai. Great value, professional, and clean. Highly recommend 	We have visited here multiple times during our stay in Chiang Mai and we have been very pleased. The staff and lovely and friendly and skilled at their jobs. There are so many places to choose from, it can be overwhelming, but we‚Äôre very glad with our choice.

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was clean, calming, and incredibly welcoming. The staff made us feel comfortable right away, and the entire space had such a peaceful vibe.  The masseuses were truly outstanding‚Äîprofessional, attentive, and clearly very skilled at what they do. Every movement felt intentional and effective, leaving us feeling completely relaxed and refreshed.  Considering the high quality of service, the value for the price is fantastic. If you‚Äôre in Chiang Mai and looking for a genuinely rejuvenating spa experience, we highly recommend Daracha Spa. We‚Äôll definitely be returning next time we‚Äôre in town!	Amazing massage!  60 min jet lag massage and I‚Äôve never felt more refreshed!  The massage therapist was small but mighty!  She got out the kinks in my neck and the spams knots out of my legs and back.   10/10 recommend anyone visiting the area to come and get a massage here.  The facility is clean, smells great and is so pretty!  The massage therapist here are professional, and courteous.  Will get another massage or two before I leave the city!!!! 	Very good massage, calm atmosphere, kind people and the little offerings before and after the massage complete a beautiful experience! 	I had a very good foot massage, and my partner traditional Thai massage in the evening, busy place but only had to wait about 15 minutes for available staff. Hot tea before and after, friendly and welcoming with a pleasant atmosphere. Recommended. Will go again üëçüôèüëç ‚Ä¶ 	Counter staff very very friendly, but the massage service staff was very rude. They gave a check list the make sure which part you wanna stronger which part don‚Äôt touch. But the massage staff even didn‚Äôt see it seems. The environment was very clean that‚Äôs all. 	Worth every penny. We did the 1 hour foot scrub with foot and leg massage. They were very friendly and place was cool, so was nice to get out of the heat. Greeted with iced tea and upon completion, you get hot tea and snacks. I'm sure everything they offer would be just as good, so you can't go wrong. Highly recommend. 	The massage itself was great but it was all the other small things that really made the experience fantastic. Super attentive and kind. When my partner had a small coughing fit, they brought her something for her throat with warm tea. And at the end presented us with more tea and local cookies. Brilliant all round experience! 	Unfortunately I can only give 3 stars. The massage itself was very very good! Like the back, shoulder & feet massage. Like 5 stars! I was a bit disappointed by the head massage, it was quite boring and short. What I actually didn‚Äôt like were a few small points: the beginning was like a rush, I just saw my tea but there was zero time to drink it, the lady washed my feet super fast. I had to pay in advance, I never experienced that before. So it was difficult to calm down and relax at the beginning. Additionally it was very noisy. Not the lady who did the massage was talking, but the other staff and I had the feeling the door was open. So you can hear the traffic easily. If you don‚Äôt mind these little things I can recommend this place, but I wish for a more quiet and slow atmosphere. 	A nice experience in Dachara Spa. I had a tradtional Thai massage course this time and got totally relaxed after 90 minutes. I would like to recommend to those who wannna try Thai massage. Plus the snacks after the course was good. 	such an amazing first time experience. i believe i got a traditional thai massage which was amazing and i felt reborn after. i loved the stretching and yoga involved and when she cracked my back, WOW! overall the whole experience was extremely relaxing, we revived a jasmine foot soak and scrub before and had some sweet treats after. would recommend to anyone and will definitely be coming back before my trip is over!!! 	Fantastic Thai Massage! 1 hour session makes wonders with your body, total relaxation guaranteed! Space is so nicely decorated, staff is super friendly and kind, and most importantly - it‚Äôs very clean and fresh! Dimmed light and calm music. I wish I had come earlier to this place - try to book in advance as it can be fully occupied. 	Daracha Spa staff were amazing , they were attentive and knew all the sore spot . We felt light and refreshed after the 1 hr Thai massage , overall 10/10 experience!! 	It was my first massage experience in Asia and before I had a 10 hour bus trip I decided to take this massage because it looked very welcoming. What should I say? I never felt so good afterwards. Thank you so much for treating me so good. My neck, shoulder and back never felt so relieved. 	Great sevice from the start until the end. Nice and neat place, masseuses were top notch! Best experience 	BEST MASSAGE OF MY LIFE!!! I got the hour long Thai massage and it felt like time stopped completely. She literally got to every part of my body somehow in an hour and I need a lot of pressure and she absolutely delivered and I feel incredible! My boyfriend got the neck and shoulder and back massage and he also said his was incredible! After the massage they gave us the sweetest tea and treat setup and at 350 baht each plus tip it was such a good price for an amazing experience!! 10 out of 10 would recommend and we will be back again before we leave Chiang Mai!!! 	Had 3 massages there in 1 week. Great experience! Very kind people. Clean and professional. Appreciated as well the washing of the feet before the massage and the tea and cookie afterwards! 	Great experience! The environment was extremely relaxing and I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Chiang Mai. I recieved the "Foot, Back, and Shoulder" massage and it was lovely!  They started off with a quick cleanse of the feet in a flower petal bowl of water followed by some sort of sugar scrub.  My partner and I was then led upstairs to our respective rooms with curtains. The music was extremely calming and the employees were very kind. I never knew my back could pop as much as it did today!  üóí Please note if you do not speak Thai, they do seem limited in English.

It was the best massage I received in Thailand. I am willing to revisit. üòÄ ‚Ä¶ 	Visited thrice during our trip as it was walking distance from our hotel. Clean and relaxing environment and good massage. The Khao taen served at the end of the massage was so yummy we ended up buying some as souvenirs!  We were in a couples room and the only complaint is the masseuses were chatting for the first 10min during the massage. 	Absolutely impressed by the services. This was my first time getting a Traditional thai massage and I had a moderate shoulder and back pain issue. I must admit it was completely resolved after the 60 min of Thai massage. And how they greet is what makes you comfortable in their environment. Loved every bit of it. Highly recommend!! 	Got the traditional Thai massage with balm for 600 baht for 60 min. It's pricier but also a higher tier of ambience and skill. Specifically, they had dedicated rooms with real, elevated massage tables so I didn't have to squish my neck facing one direction on a flat surface.  Masseuse provided a good level of pressure (I prefer strong massages), and focused on the areas I specified on the intake form (vs following a standard sequence).  	We googled for spa with shower as we planned to massage, shower then go back to hotel to collect luggage and head off to airport for evening flight. In the couple room, there is ensuite toilet and shower stall, also a changing stall with hangers and full length mirror. In the shower, u find shampoo and shower gel. The staff also brot me a hair dryer, how considerate of them! Maybe it's their usu practice or bec we are here on off peak, no one hurried me as I shower and  changed. Both my hubby and I had the most relaxing massage we both dozed off. I had aroma oil body massage and Indian head massage which was also very relaxing with warm oil drizzled onto your scalp, scalp, shoulder and neck massage. Would help highly recommend to anyone wanting to while time after checkout. 	It was the best foot massage I‚Äôve ever had! Perfect amount of pressure and nice scrub before. Would recommend :) 	Visiting from the US, my friend and I walked by this establishment during the vibrant chaos and whimsy of water fights for Songkran. After a little splash from some of the staff :0) , we took a look at the menu of options and walked inside. As last minute guests, they offered immediate foot massages. A full body would be available later that evening. But we were open to foot massages in the moment!  I spoke with the owner for a little while, as we waited, who is so kind and friendly and has such a joy for Thailand, as a transplant. He manages a clean, serene space that feels like a little slice of paradise behind the entry door. And the staff seems so cheerful and eager to serve and connect.  We had Laa and Benz to massage us, who are both very wonderful, warm, hospitable. They spent time chatting with us and teaching us Thai words. I showed Laa a photo of my ankle from two months ago to let her know that I had sustained a severe sprain. She took extra care to be gentle and give me a tiger balm type ointment to soothe the muscle. I appreciate that nurturing spirit.  Overall, we had an excellent experience, relaxing and calm and enjoyable. We would recommend this place to anyone! 	The massages at ChabaPrai are amazing - and great value. When you arrive, you are served cool tea and rice cakes. The foot massage begins with a foot scrub in flower infused water. There‚Äôs also fragrant flowers in a bowl under the face hole in the massage table. The head, neck, shoulder back massage will be extended to legs and arms too.  Only drawbacks: The massage tables (as all in Thailand) are harder than in the US and they don‚Äôt put pillows or bolsters under your knees when you‚Äôre lying on your back. The quality and value of the massages more than make up for that 	For the first time ever we've had a traditional Thai full body massage and we absolutely loved it! The women were so kind and the ambiance is great. We truely feel rejuvenated and that the energy can flow again. Thank you so much! 	Best experience!  Everyone was kind and very professional. We got a cold tea and towel as we entered and a warm tea and a rice treat to end the massage. It was honestly more than expected and would definitely recommend ! Thank you !! ‚ú® 	Definitely one of the best places for traditional Thai massage in Chiang Mai, I can only recommend it Nicely decorated, clean, good service 	We had amazing massages and facials. The service was great, the environment was relaxing, and we came out rejuvenated and very happy. Highly recommend! 	Came here based on proximity to hotel and reviews. I was not dissapointed - It is the best Thai massage I've ever had, and I would actually go to far as to say the best massage I've ever had. Incredibly skill. Great relaxing atmosphere.	I had an aroma oil massage here and absolutely loved it! It was at the branch opposite De Lanna Hotel on Intrawarorot Road - a very clean and spacious place with a relaxing ambience. The staff were friendly, welcoming, and well-informed. Great value for the top quality service you will get at this masssge spa. Highly recommended! 	My husband and I had wonderful head to toe massage! Just what we needed after a long day of travel yesterday. We did the Duo package #5! Great deal as well for 2 hours. 	Very good massage! They start with a little welcome drink and a chart where you can select which body parts you want them to focus on as well as the intensity of the massage. The rooms are private and extremely clean. Definitely recommend it! 	Best Thai massage I‚Äôve ever had. Been to three places in Thailand and had two in London. This is the best I‚Äôve had of all of them.

I‚Äôve had my first Thai massage in here, 10 years ago and today again! It re-confirmed the quality and expertise the employees have and the owner wants to keep it up!  What a joy to be able to have again an excellent experience!  I can only recommend to go for a Thai massage or herbal compress massage or combine both, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!  The owner surprised me with a gift, b/c I mentioned I visited her place 10 years ago and was so happy that I found it back üôèüèª 	This Thai massage was an exceptional experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a thorough and revitalizing treatment. It‚Äôs an ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, leaving you refreshed and renewed. I can‚Äôt wait to return for another session! 	I spent my last day (and birthday) here for 3 hours and got the Deep Thai Tension Tame and facial. The massage changed my life and removed all the possible tension lingering in my body. Made me understand the idea "the body keeps score". 	It's ok if you just want a rub, and to rest the legs for an hour...  I personally wouldn't go the 2 hr 'special ' as it would be better spent outside the old town...  I've had Better technique from some of the street side places!  Also the 'free gift' for a Google review adds to the imbalance in actual reality...  For 300 baht an hour it could be worse, it could definitely be better though!  2.5 to 3 stars 	I had an amazing experience during my two-session head, neck, and foot massage! The service was outstanding‚Äîvery professional, relaxing, and exactly what I needed. Plus, the price was fantastic. Highly recommend! 	Very nice massage place with reasonable price. Masseurs are professional and other staff are so friendly and helpful. Had a wonderful and relaxing time here. Greatly recommend 	I have lived in Thailand for a year. This is the best massage that I have had. I did the 2 hour massage with hot compress. It is so nice because they start with your feet, which relaxes your muscles all over your body, do the hot compress to relax your back muscles even more, then do the massage. You‚Äôre basically butter at the end :) 	The massage itself is pretty good, so we decided to come back again today and make a booking. We paid in advance and arranged our evening around the booking.  After coming back at our booked time, we were asked if we could wait an extra 20-30 mins because the people before us decided to extend their massage by 30 minutes.  We had other plans for the evening so we had to cancel and leave, but the fact our booking time and repeat business didn‚Äôt mean anything left a sour taste in our mouth.  They offered a 10% discount as an apology but we are leaving tomorrow so it‚Äôs not useful for us. Shame really, because it spoiled our previous experience. 	We had foot massage here. Excellent  massage. Very friendly, professional staff. 1 star less because the chairs for foot massage were not comfortable and the lighting in the foot massage area was not so pleasant. 	The best massage I have ever gotten. I was completely tight from all my flying in Asia and I was completely stretched out and rubber all that away. I will be coming back during my stay in Thailand. Cannot recommend enough 	I visited this place on the last day of my trip. After a massage, I was so recharged that I almost started the trip all over again.  C&R = Christiano & Ronaldo, Siuuuuuuu!!!!!! 	The environment is decent. I had green bean body scrub and aloe vera whole body massage. My therapist Aoi can communicate in simple English and her skill was awesome. Aoi was dedicated and concentrated on the key areas. A great massage experience. 	Very good Thai massage! I recommend this. When arriving you get water. If you want, you can take a shower before the massage. The massage itself is from very good quality. After the massage you get a thee. 	My husband and I have been trying different places and going for massage every day. This was the best one. We will make sure to come back again. We purchased the 2 hour - foot and full body massage for 690 baht special. Incredible!! 	We went to this lovely place during our stay in Chiang Mai, the two lovely masseuses were fantastic, so friendly and gave a great foot massage! Unfortunately didn‚Äôt catch their names. Very accommodating and relaxing place. 	We visited the C and R massage shop after search lots of blogs and we knew we made the best choice! Staff are nice and kind and the massage agents have a great skill! The shop provided us the upgraded package and it was really nice! 	I had a warm compress massage for neck, back shoulders. My therapist only rubbed my back , no shoulders or neck before putting the warm compress. And I say rub because there was no massage unfortunately.. I‚Äôve been to many massage places but this one was disappointing.

One hour of pure pleasure, I'll come tomorrow. For information, foot massage with herbal beaulm one hour -> 450 B. And we could keep the baulm after, and we were offered a tea before leaving. Incredible üëå  Why again should I leave Tha√Øland ? ü§î 	First impressions: the parlor looks clean and serene and calm from the outside which is exactly the experience I wanted. I was looking for a zen massage place and this delivered. The service by the receptionist was lovely. There are refreshments served at the beginning and end of the experience. You first get your feet washed which is such a great beginning after all the walking. We got the body scrub and nourishment which would highly recommend. The ladies were sooo lovely to us and thorough. Honestly one of the best treatments I‚Äôve had. Would come again. 	Very very comfortable and detailed 1 hr foot massage, I think it‚Äôs worth the price, booked the slot on klook, RM41.7 (around 314 thai baht), u can fully lay down on the sofa and take a good recharge during your chiang mai trip. 	We accidentally discovered this wonderful place, Relax Express. We tried the Traditional Thai Massage, and it was absolutely amazing! Both relaxing and invigorating at the same time‚Äîjust what we needed. Complimentary tea was offered before the massage, and after, we enjoyed tea with snacks. The staff is very welcoming and professional. Highly recommend! 	I had a wonderful experience getting a foot massage at this place. The environment is super clean, calm, and relaxing, with soft music that creates the perfect atmosphere for unwinding.  The therapist was incredibly attentive, with impeccable technique that completely relieved the fatigue and tension in my feet. The pressure was applied perfectly, tailored to my needs, and I left feeling refreshed and light.  The customer service was excellent from the moment I arrived until the end of the session. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and rejuvenating experience. Totally worth it! 	My favourite Thai massage spot - a little on the pricier side by the staff here are so kind and good at what they do. They helped discover and treat problem areas on my body and give extra attention to those areas. They really listen to your needs. I‚Äôll recommend them every time. Tea and snack is great touch too! 	Amazing experience very calming and relaxing from the moment you walk in. Very quiet and only a little calming music. Complimentary drinks before and after service. The whole venue is clean and well laid out. Everyone is lovely and professional. The body scrub was amazing could not recommend it enough! 100% would come here again 	It‚Äôs just wonderful!!! Every time after Thai traditional massage i‚Äôm feeling like just borne again. Recommend minimum 3 or 5 times did it restart for your body)) 	The masseuse danced along my spine not touching my spine once. I had a Thai oil massage and was made very relaxed, true to their name.  Would definitely recommend a visit ‚ò∫Ô∏è 	What an experience ! Perfect massage in old part of Chiang Mai. Staff is super polite. 	It was really relaxing and comfortable. The atmosphere was calm and i‚Äôve received a great massage. Body felt much better after the massage. Wish i knew here sooner during the trip! 	Nice welcome, friendly staff and massage is according to your wishes. Family friendly and ending with an aromatic cup of tea. For sure a place to come back to! 	Great staff, receptionist speaks English very well. Nice atmosphere and prices. Overall highly recommend. 	The experience at Relax Express was amazing. The staff was pleasant and dedicated. We had a 60-minute foot massage, which started with a foot wash and scrub, continued with compressions and other things while they made sure we were as comfortable as possible. The atmosphere is relaxing and amazing. We were also treated to a short head and neck massage. At the end, we were served tea and a rice cake on beautiful dishes. The overall experience was amazing, we left feeling like new. 	I had a great pleasure from the massage yesterday!  I felt cosy and cared for while there, and after a traditional Thai massage, I fell asleep sweetly as a baby.  I'll be back again today üòÄ 	Great foot massage!

They offer authentic Thai massages with customizable strength preferences. The environment is old-school, featuring beds and fans instead of air conditioning, which enhances the breathing experience during the massage for maximum relaxation.  Pin and Dada were fantastic masseuses, delivering a thorough and professional massage. After the session, tea and snacks were served, adding a nice touch to the experience. The price point is very affordable for a 2-hour massage, making it great value for money.  Easily reachable via Grab or by foot if you‚Äôre staying near the Tha Phae Gate area. Highly recommended for a true Thai massage experience! 	I visited here 3 days in a row - Thai massage, foot & leg massage, and sports massage.  All were amazing!  If you get the sports massage be prepared for some intense pressure, which I loved... But, many may consider it too strong.  The lady that seemed to be in charge spoke great English and was able to pass along my requests to the massage therapist.  I will definitely be back! 	Fantastic massage place and lovely staff. Honestly, this place is the best massage I've ever been in Chiang Mai. The oil massage felt like a deep tissue session, working out all the knots. Thai mass and foot massage  I left feeling relaxed and renewed.  Highly recommend! üíÜ Sometimes might be fully booked. Better calling ahead for a reservation. Well worth it! 	First time doing a massage here in Thailand üáπüá≠ and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed ü§© Karina Thai Massage had the sweetest ladies that massaged our back, neck, shoulders, and head. Very skilled with cracking our backs and a nice oil to make the massaging go very smoothly ü´∂üèº  We dropped in without an appointment and they were happy to receive us at 8PM!  The ladies chatted a little amongst themselves and also with us. It sounded like they had lots of fun doing their job ‚ô°üíï  The prices are also very good! For one hour, this specific massage was 350 baht. The towels and massage bench are very clean, and you get a refreshing water to drink at the end.  Thank you so much for having us Karina Thai massage, we wish we stayed longer in Chiang Mai to visit you more often! Until next time ‚ô° 	Fantastic massage place. A small place with four massage tables. This allows the owner to carefully select who works there. I must honestly say, this was the best massage I've gotten in Chiang Mai (yes I've tried all the over hyped places like the blind massage, the prisoner massage, etc - those places don't even come close). The oil massage was similar to a deep tissue massage and all the knots were patiently worked out. After, i felt like new.  I would recommend calling for a reservation ahead of time. Well worth it. Highly recommend this place. 	Absolutely outstanding place to experience a perfect thai massage!!! More than competent staff, charming and very clean location, truly the best place I'm aware of to enjoy a professional massagel treatment. A "must be" for sure when travelling to Chiang Mai next time, Karina Thai Massage being even another good reason to come back to this wonderful city. 	Sports Massage // 2hrs  Small, but clean and quaint shop, with great attention to atmosphere and detail‚Äîthe bed linens were taut and cutely decorated.  I've been having some lower back aches and mobility issues from training hard for adventure sports, and the session was really comprehensive in orientation towards improving mobility.  The therapist was clearly knowledgeable and experienced, important for the deep tissue work required in a sports massage.  After the session was over, I was treated to tea and cookies. A thoughtful touch! 	The best massage I've ever had. I picked deep tissue massage as needed work on my painful knotted muscles. The young lady called Lat was just amazing. Very strong, but very attentive same time. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and highly recommend this place if you want a good quality massage. 	This place is special.  Top notch experienced skills in massage with sensitivity.  I felt an exceptional level of positive energy.  Very clean and thoughtful touches everywhere from massage table to a cup of tea.  Highly recommended.  Simply the best! 	I had a old injury to my elbow and arm which needed some deep work. I went to Karina for her deep tissue massage after seeing another review from a customer. Karina was amazing!! Definitely worth going if you are looking for a good massage therapist. I am a massage therapist myself and always find it difficult finding someone who understands what your body needs. It also helps as Karina‚Äôs English is very good. I would go regularly if I lived in Chang Mai. Karina will not disappoint! 	Nai was in charge this morning and I had a great aroma massage. She was very attentive to my health issues and gave me the best massage so far. I already booked the next one with her in a few days üòä I totally recommend the place, everyone is professional (I had previously a massage with Lucksamee, she's very good too) and  so nice, and Karina is great. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town 	100% recommend. Maybe the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. The masseuses were professional, knowledgeable, and kind! And very affordable price. 	Had the pleasure of getting a massage from Karina today. I am a physician and recently had shoulder surgery.Karina worked with me for two hours. She clearly knows her technique and her passion for helping people was obvious! Only regret was not finding her sooner in my stay in Chiangmai, she is a level above most here. Highly recommend! 	1st experience the sheer delight of a rejuvenating foot massage at this exquisite spot! My visit here left me in awe as I indulged in a truly relaxing massage. But that's not all ‚Äì the highlight of my day was getting to know the charming ladyboss, Karina. Her warm hospitality and vast knowledge about Chiang Mai's hidden gems, especially during the enchanting winter season, made my experience even more fulfilling.  Karina's professionalism shines through, and she genuinely cares about her guests' well-being. Her skilled hands work wonders, leaving you feeling invigorated and refreshed after the massage. This is the place to unwind after a long journey or a bustling day in Chiang Mai.  2nd visit I still had the pleasure of experiencing Karina's exceptional foot massage skills, and it was truly remarkable. She displayed a deep understanding of muscle and nerve points, which was especially helpful in alleviating the soreness in my legs from rigorous physical training. What added to the unique experience was Karina introducing me to their Thai massage with her signature staff, Koi. I must say that Koi delivered one of the best Thai massages I've ever had. Overall, my second visit was nothing short of fantastic, thanks to Karina and Koi's expertise and their commitment to providing a top-notch experience. 	Amazing Massage! They called more staff to cater for the 3 of us. It was the first time getting a Massage from a man, so I was a bit worried, but Kong (not sure if I got his name right) was a true professional, it was truly one of the best Massages I have ever had!! Also sooo friendly people! Loved it so much, felt super relaxed afterwards, thank you so much! üíû 	100% recommend this place! I have a back condition, and am usually in a lot of pain. They understood it well, and handled it effectively, but calmly. 	Karina was one of the loveliest people I've met in Thailand - cares so much about getting all the knots out and that you have a great experience. Absolutely recommend the neck back and head massage if you have a tight neck/back. Wish I had longer in Chiang Mai so I could come back again!
