<strong><u>P'Lex</u></strong> gave an amazing Thai massage, perfect pressure and very professional approach.
<strong><u>Song's technique</u></strong> was incredible, exactly what I needed after a long flight.
The <strong><u>signature Po Thai program</u></strong> left me feeling completely refreshed and energized.
<strong><u>Professional staff</u></strong> and clean facilities made my foot massage experience wonderful.
The <strong><u>snake powder treatment</u></strong> after massage was unique and left my skin feeling amazing.
<strong><u>Excellent service</u></strong> and convenient location near BTS made this place my go-to spot.
<strong><u>Skilled therapist</u></strong> found and released all my shoulder tension perfectly.

Massage oil wasn't fresh, caused skin irritation and had to visit hospital.
The therapist seemed inexperienced, massage was too soft and not worth the price.
