I go here often.  The price is more expensive than other massage shops in Thailand.  There are some massage therapists who are not very good at times, but overall I am satisfied. 	I had a great massage here. Walk in no appointment needed (but might need to make one at busier times or for groups/specific services). Across from Donki Mall and it was next to my lodging so very convenient if you‚Äôre staying in the area.  Reception spoke English and could explain their membership program. If you‚Äôre staying for a longer period may be a good option.	Service is excellent!! I booked through Class pass application for 2 hours (Foot & Thai massage) Khun Thong, the masseur, provided very polite massage and strong endurance. I do recommended the place 	Really great quality of staff considering it's a chain. Service is attentive and nice. Def recommend making a reservation before going as it's a pretty busy location. 	I booked a Head & Shoulder Massage which cost 400 Baht for 60 mins! The receptionist is polite and friendly ‚ò∫Ô∏è I waited 10 mins sitting on the couch at the lobby and I was bringing into the massage room, the massage lady is professionally doing her job üòÅ I like the service! ‚Ä¶ 	Clean, relax, comfy plc.  Good massage. 	Good professional service, water and tea free	Rude, incompetent staff (manager / administrator), maybe this problem is only in this branch, but I never got to the massage, have no desire to get relaxation here 	Got a shoulder and neck massage and it was just pathetic. She was basically just touching me. Do they just learn from YouTube videos now days? 	First impression, the lobby is very clean and well designed. I had a full body oil massage. The masseuse was very experienced  and did an awesome job taking away all the knots. My whole body felt relaxed during and after the massage. It‚Äôs well worth the money. 	Semi-rude receptionist, tried so hard to upsell massages. My masseuse was 15 mins later than the ones my companions received, and when she finally arrived she gave me the worst foot massage of my life. I basically just paid 450 baht for a foot rub. The entire hour I was just waiting for it to end. Also, I think several of the masseuses were sick, they kept coughing. Not recommended.	I really impressed with their services. I‚Äôve been the member here and always come here. Every time I came here, I try to test other massage types and it‚Äôs not disappoint me at all hahaha. Also, the salon is quite good but the hair towel a bit smelly! Hope you might solve this small issue haha. Anyway, I still recommend you guys who finding Thai massage which is a painless massage Please try this store ^^ 	This is the worst massage I have ever experienced. The lady seemed completely clueless about what she was doing, merely stroking my feet without any pressure throughout the session. When I requested more pressure, they started using excessive force, causing me pain rather than relaxation. 	I always go to Lek massage for a genuinely amazing and relaxing massage and my manicure\pedicure and hair needs. The service is 5 star. My partner and I desperately wanted a foot massage at 23:30 and I really appreciate that Lek massage thong lor managed to fit us in for two 30 min massages right before closing. Thank you very much and see you again soon 	I chose foot and hand spa Include normal nail polish.foot spa There is no disposable bag, which is unsanitary and the clerk does not provide it. We told the clerk to cancel spa only polishÔºå The clerk actually gave us all the money back and asked us to do it somewhere else. Very speechless and poor service attitude. 	If you find a therapist named Addy, you won't regret it. I got a really cool Thai massage and felt professional that I've never felt at other shops. I'm a professional trainer and I'm good at recognizing muscle movements. 	I love coming to this place. Mae Kat is amazing, every time I come in with pain in certain areas I wouldn‚Äôt tell her where it is, yet she manages to find it and massage it better. If does have a heavy grip but if you are like me (who loves tough massages) then she would be the one for you. 	Massage was ok, good pressure and good techniques. But the masseur my friend and I had kept talking and laughing for no reason. Could have been more professional and respectful while we were trying to relax and sleep. Rooms were filled with mosquitos too.	Was having shoulder issues in my right rotator cuff.  A woman named Duen did a great job with deep-tissue massage- pressure applied specifically at correct spots.  Great massage, good, clean place; I'll be back	DO NOT GET YOUR NAILS DONE HERE. My gel manicure lifted in a couple of days and the cuticle was prepped well. Got a pedicure done as well but you have to pay extra to scrape the dead skin off your feet (which is a first it‚Äôs usually included) but the base of my feet was still flaky and wasn‚Äôt smooth.
