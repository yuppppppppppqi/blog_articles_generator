<strong><u>Sport's massage technique</u></strong> was perfect, strong pressure that worked out all my knots.
<strong><u>Professional staff</u></strong> maintained peaceful atmosphere despite the busy location.
<strong><u>Tham's foot massage</u></strong> was incredible, best I've experienced in Bangkok.
The <strong><u>Thai massage</u></strong> worked every single muscle, perfect after long days of walking.
<strong><u>Excellent value</u></strong> for money, quality matches more expensive places.
<strong><u>C's technique</u></strong> was amazing, first time someone could crack my back so well.
<strong><u>Strong pressure</u></strong> and skilled technique made this massage truly therapeutic.
<strong><u>Clean environment</u></strong> and friendly staff made the experience very comfortable.
Privacy could be better, curtains were open and it felt a bit exposed.
Requested head and neck massage but got mostly back, staff kept talking throughout.
