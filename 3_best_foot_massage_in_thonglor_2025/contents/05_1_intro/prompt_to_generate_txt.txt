Massages are super affordable - average 320 baht for 1 hour. I got a massage by both male and female masseuses and they were very professional and respectful. There is a communal effort to make both private and public massage rooms quiet so don’t feel intimidated by the sometimes crowded appearance! 	Massage was excellent. Simple massage area and not comparable to the high end massage places in BKK. Thus, price points are relatively quite reasonable. Tried the traditional and also the aroma (oil) - and not were so good. Must try! 	Had absolutely fantastic thai massage here! One of the best of all the times I've been to Thailand since 2012. Every single muscle in my body was worked on in that hour! 	My husband and I went here for the Thai massage based on other great google reviews. They do a great job of undoing the stress your body feels after days of exploring Bangkok climbing lots of stairs on the BTS etc. Great location in Thong Lor and professional and effective massage. We will be back for sure. 	Perfect Thai massage for good price, thank you! 	Absolutely wonderful massage from Sport. I wasn’t sure as the place is busy and everyone is packed in but once you are in place (and they insist on silence , creating a very peaceful atmosphere) it’s perfect. I felt so safe. I’ve always requested a female masseuse in the past but felt so safe with Sport. The massage itself was 1.5 hours and did me so much good. Some pain and cracking but much needed! Highly recommend! 	Walked in for a massage and everyone there was so nice and friendly. The place is clean and smells lovely. The massage was so good and price was great. I wish I had time to come back more often. Highly recommended . 	went here for massage twice because once was not enough! my masseuse tham was so good and really one of the best foot massages ive ever had! price is very value for money too and would definitely come back in the future if im staying nearby! 	Definitely the best massage experience I ever had!!!!! Every single time of rubbing is precisely right to the pain point. I will definitely come back again! 	Definitely one of my favourite massage shops in town, been visiting here over 3 times back and forth, they always provide an excellent service when it comes to Thai massage! On top of that, the price is affordable as well! I’ll surely go back again when I come to BKK the next time :) 	I asked for head&neck massage, and half of the massage was on my back … I asked meanwhile but she didn’t really respond … plus during the massage the workers constantly whispering between them which is fine if it’s occasional but for an hour you don’t want to hear your massagist don’t stop talking. Price was affordable, total Was OK, but I won’t come back 	This is a very good authentic Thai spa ! The therapist I had was skilled and delivered an amazing massage. The price is good too and reception staff is friendly.  Now my only negative comment is that it wasn’t very private. It’s a small and busy spa. There are curtains isolating you from other guests but they are very close to you and during my massage all curtains were actually open, which didn’t make me feel very comfortable.  Still think it’s a good affordable spa. 	Tried several massage in this neighborhood, this one is the BEST! Best value, most professional masters, simple but the best! Recommend to massage lover. We will definitely come back. 	We went here because it was the higher rated place compared to surrounding massage places, and they accept card. The masseuse was good in looking for knots, but would sometimes knead bones. Pressure was okay.  I got the back neck shoulder massage but it felt like a normal thai massage (200 baht cheaper than the back massage rate) with extra focus on back. I actually don't like the stretching so I didn't get a thai massage.  Also, it would have been okay but the masseuse pulled a muscle and I got injured from it. Now it's difficult to turn my head to the left. I told the receptionist about it and they just looked at me and laughed. There was no apology or asking about the injury.  Massage okay (3 star maybe for the rate) if they didn't injure me and laughed. 	One of strength is near by hotel and staff skill is very nice. especially foot and traditional thai massage. Actually i dont take aroma-massage. Sorry 	They’re always booked! Make sure to make a reservation thru LINE. In general, the therapists are above average and they work really hard! I’ve been visiting here everyday with my dad while we’re staying in Bangkok.  FYI: Credit card available (3% fee excluded). 	I’ve been here twice, the lady called (C or Si) is amazing, for the first time someone could crack me like this, good price also. 	Best massage I’ve done. Went 2 days in a row - if there was more time I would have gone again. FYI it’s a strong pressure, I prefer it that way and thought it was great. Friendly staff and clean space too.	Good massage place, foot massage are done on massage table instead of the lazy couch so the whole leg will be well massaged. 	Massage is good with strong pressure that i like. It will be good if the privacy of the room can be improved. I was shocked when i stepped in a room and saw a man with upper body naked.
