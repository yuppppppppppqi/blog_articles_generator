The place is fresh and super clean. The ladies so attentive and the doctors really professional with a good technique. I personally recommend deep tissue massage 60 or 90 minutes and you’re fresh and ready for your next adventure! I always get out of there felling like a million bucks! Thanks a lot for a great service, see you very soon! 	This was a terrible foot massage experience. If it were possible, I would give it a negative star rating. The person performing the massage had no skill whatsoever. Please help to ensure your staff skill quality as some is still very good but not the young guy. 	Came here twice on my trip with 4 people for foot massage. Both times the technicians were all excellent and the place is very clean. Nice music also! 	Very poor quality massage considering the price of 700 baht, I wouldn't have paid more than 50 for this level of skill. I asked the massage girl how long she had studied and she said just 1 month 	I found that it seems like a new shop and look like clean so I went into it in the morning. The reception called a masseur for me with 60 min Thai message.  It was conducted on 2/F that it’s really new and clean that I felt so comfortable. The masseur also provided good massage to me.  However, it is closed to the main road that it is not very quiet to relax.  Overall it was a decent one. 	Very good expérience at Wara Massage for 1h aroma deep tissue. Staff Very Nice and shop Very clean and beautiful. I recommand it. 	Seems like a new shop. Place is new and clean, but the massage quality was a bit lackluster 	Went there a few days ago on my last day in BKK.  First 2 visits were great dont get me wrong but during the last visit, I got the 60-minutes traditional Thai massage and they arranged a relatively young, short hair masseur to me. these are the things that i didnt like:  1. For the first 15 minutes, she was playing her phone while elbowing my lower back 2. I got changed and left my bag under the bed on a wooden tray only to realise that I've lost some of the cash. (I'm not blindly accusing because it was my friend's cash and the bag was not opened at all times from our hotel at one one bangkok to wara and back to hotel). The only time the bag has left my sight was during this massage session) We didn't go back and make a fuss. Writing this to all clients to be aware of such theft not just here but everywhere. Nothing personal  It could be just one rotten apple.	Super nice service, i fall down my air pod, and went back to the shop, the staffs kept well and gave back to me, super thankful!!! 	The place is very clean and therapists are very profressional.  Probably best one  around there 	The best massage ever 	Massager K Oh is so good 	Today I chose 2 clocks neck and shoulder. The 20-year-old male technician is strong enough. This shop has the most people. 	I stayed at a hotel in Thonglor for a family trip and received a massage at Wara Massage. It was new, so it was very clean, I liked the facilities, and the people working there greeted me with a bright smile and were friendly.  And when I first went there, I remember two people working hard to clean the outside window. It looked clean inside and out.  The most important thing was that the massage was completely refreshing. The pressure was just right and I asked them to gently massage the painful area. My shoulder was very sore, but they soothed the area so well that I felt so refreshed that I went twice a day. I will go again. 	WARA Massage located across from the Thonglor Centerpoint Hotel where I spent two days. The facility was clean and seemed to be the newest facility in the area. I had a foot massage one day and a Thai massage one day. The price was good too. 	I went twice. I was satisfied with the foot massage on the first day, so I gave him a large tip and got a Thai massage the next day, but I felt like I fell asleep during the massage twice. They also gave a tip of 50 baht, but the expression on their face... It was a struggle, but I didn't go the next day. If you're going to receive it, just do it with your feet.	Under the guidance of a chubby male manager Reserve 1 hour of Thai massage (350 baht, reasonable price) They told me to wait 2 minutes, but I waited 15 minutes. Amazing Thailand. After changing into silk-like massage clothes and lying down on the somewhat narrow bed, I felt like all my fatigue was being relieved by the cozy pillow, which was nice.  A rather strong-looking older sister with yellow hair cut Although I'm not strong, I was satisfied with applying Yamong and doing my best to improve my shoulder since it hurt.  I gave this massage shop 5 points to mean that I should pay more attention to the massage shop where I felt better than the best. May you prosper.  The cost-effectiveness is awesome At this price on Thonglor Street, what do you want?^^	While staying at Center Point Thonglor, it was the cleanest and friendliest massage shop I've ever been to across the street. I went there when it was crowded and was a bit hesitated, but after getting the massage, everything immediately calmed down and it was great. I recommend it. 	While I was in Bangkok for 6 days and 5 nights, I had 2 massages per day and it was the best place I've ever been to. I was so satisfied that I gave a tip of 100 baht. 	I had a massage with Roy, the woman was excellent. I have never had a very precise person, I recommend him.
