<strong><u>Deep tissue massage</u></strong> was exactly what I needed, therapist found every knot.
<strong><u>K Oh's technique</u></strong> was exceptional, perfect pressure and attention to problem areas.
<strong><u>Professional staff</u></strong> and clean environment made the experience very comfortable.
<strong><u>Roy's massage skills</u></strong> were precise and effective, best I've experienced here.
The <strong><u>Thai massage</u></strong> completely relieved my shoulder pain, will definitely return.
<strong><u>Excellent service</u></strong> and modern facilities made this place stand out.
<strong><u>Skilled therapist</u></strong> gave perfect attention to my sore muscles.
<strong><u>Clean and fresh</u></strong> environment with friendly, attentive staff.
Young therapist lacked experience, massage was too soft and ineffective.
Road noise was quite distracting, and the room felt a bit too warm.
