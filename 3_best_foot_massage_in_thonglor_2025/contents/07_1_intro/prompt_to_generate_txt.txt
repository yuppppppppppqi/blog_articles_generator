One foot massage and  two whole body massages.  The place is simple but spotless.  The masseuses are excellent and kind.  It is not a snobby place. The prices are fair.  The owner is often there with her cute golden retriever puppy.  The location is great just across from the Hotel Nikko and around the corner from Le Petite Salil Hotel.  There are many good Japanese restaurants nearby for dinner after your massage.  You can easily contact the shop using the LINE app.	Good massage at a decent store. The only thing that can be improved is washing feet before massage. Due to not washing my feet ahead of starting the massage, I felt a little bit uncomfortable(non-hygenic) during massage time.	Amazing massage. I called an hour before, walked in and chose 30 mins back and shoulder, 30 mins foot massage. I believe my masseuse’s name is Mina, she was so skilled and thorough. I have tried a few other places in thong lor, this will be my new go-to, especially because I’m a volleyball player and my legs are always sore. 	Highly recommended !  We have visited this shop 3 times in our trip .It is a clean and comfortable massage shop in thong lor. The staff are very nice and professional especially KAI and LINLY. ❤️ They help me and my mum relieve our muscle pain . Will come back next time :)	Did foot massage for my first visit and Aromatherapy for my second visit. Good deal as it has promotion offers if you book online! Shopkeeper and staffs are friendly and welcoming. 	Tried body aroma massage. Two of us went there, both of our therapists were not quite skilful. 	Super nice massage place. Decent price (about 50 baht over average- but it’s 1000% worth it). You don’t really hear the noise of the busy road and you have privacy curtains, so u can relax without feeling like everyone’s staring at u. If you are looking for a relaxing foot, back, or full body massage this is the place! 	Not bad but masseuses are sleeping almost everywhere downstairs. Makes it look unprofessional. 	I been here twice,first time with mu husband we had foot massage (It was great, very relaxing great super nice staff) and second time I been myself and had neck shoulders and back massage and again it was great! Top standard,  place looks little bit run down but staff is highly capable and professional very good with their job, great prices I would say under priced for level of massage you getting from these lovely ladies 🥰🥰👌👌 	Indulge in pure bliss as skilled hands work their magic, melting away stress and tension. Best massage and I came continuously for 2 days. The opening hours is quite late, no more worries on massage after a late night shopping👍🏻 … 	The worst massage in Thailand. My masseur was NO SKILL AT ALL and looks tired of life. Went back in 2022 after a few years. Price gone up quality gone way down. You can find better massage elsewhere. 	Excellent massage in Tong Lor. clean shop, very friendly, knowledgeable staff and helpful english speaking management that will guide you for the best experience. The therapist really helped with my muscle and joints pain 	Had a frozen shoulder. Booked 1 hour of massage. Very skillfull masseuse, the shoulder pain has gone away. Great shop, very professional and attentative. 	Well renovated location, clean place with nice staff. The massage was not good as expected. I took foot massage, it was soft and boring.	The noise from the main road can be heard I. The treatment rooms so you don’t get true peace and quiet. It’s quite clean though. 	Ket is very good skill😍 … 	Excellent massage by professional therapists. Really good value. I’ll be going again! 	Very good services! Nice and make me feel very welcome! 	Very good. Phon is recommended. 	Don’t go, the girl here apparently doesn’t know how to do massage appropriately.
