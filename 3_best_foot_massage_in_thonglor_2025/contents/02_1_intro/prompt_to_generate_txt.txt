The staff are polite and provide great service. The massage therapists are skilled, and the place is clean and nicely decorated. It has all the necessary facilities, including an elevator. The restrooms are clean too.	600฿/60mins worths every baht.. Staffs are friendly profession and skilled..which u can ask for light pressure ..if u wanted to. (Thai massage is not for the weak please keep that in mind).Clean rooms and provided pillow coverage, fresh co-ords to change snacks and tea after. Convenient location.My masseur is P’Lex. 	I don't know why this place has such a good rating. We had a 90 minute foot massage at 8:30pm. The massage was not that great for the price. They told the customers who came at 9pm that they were closed. But they accepted a Chinese group at 10pm, which was the closing time. The main thing is that the massage oil was not fresh. After the massage, my husband got hives on his legs and neck and had to go to the hospital. I do not recommend this place. 	An excellent authentic Thai massage, nice atmosphere, and clean. The therapists are professional. I’m impressed with the signature Po Thai program.  My new favourite place in Thailand , worth it 	I had an exceptional experience with an authentic Thai massage in a welcoming atmosphere. The owner is highly professional, prioritizing hygiene and delivering outstanding service. I was truly impressed with the entire experience.  If you’re taking the BTS, get off at Thonglor Station, exit #3, and take a short walk to reach the location.  This is a must-visit spot when you’re in Bangkok—well worth every penny! 	Great spot for a foot and shoulder massage if you're done with walking around the area or just need to cool down in the AC. It's the cleanest looking facility in the area, and the ladies are lovely! Highly recommend it! 	Highly recommended!!! Clean environment, and they use the famous Thai snake powder after the oil massage!!! Which is super amazing so the legs aren’t oily at all 	Song did a wonderful job! Had many massages before but she did the best! Especially right after a long flight, this was definitely necessary! Enjoyable as well! Very well priced. Everything is clean, smells great, and kind service. Would like to come back. 	Today, I discovered a massage parlor in Thonglor that truly surprised me!  I thought massage places only offered traditional services, but this one offers foot exfoliation too! ✨  It felt like shedding old layers and being reborn!  Truly unique and refreshing!  #Massage #Thonglor #SelfCare #Exfoliation #SpaDay #300THB🫰🏻 … 	I massaged hopped for 4 days in Bangkok, when I finally discovered this gem! 💎. The interior is beautiful, calm, cool and quiet. My masseuse (#45), Ms. Rhaung (hopefully I remembered the spelling!), was AMAZING!  I love a STRONG massage, and she was full of the perfect strength and pressure. I had a foot scrub, foot massage, followed by a Thai massage. Ms. R, was perfect, I cannot express how grateful I was to find her and this spa. She is my favorite ❤️ of all time!  Thank you for the most lovely, most wonderful, most relaxing experience!  The welcome and hospitality will not be forgotten 🪷  	The shop is located in Thonglor, easy to travel, near BTS. The shop is quiet and the massage is very comfortable. 	Excellent! This is probably the best massage I have had. Good catching the pts and stretching. Foot massage was excellent too. Highly recommended. 	The therapist gave me one of the best massages I’ve ever had, especially for the shoulder and neck.  I’ve been to many massage places in Bangkok before, and this place ranks up there with one of the best.  The massage shop is very clean and has a great atmosphere.  And the therapists are very professional. 	I had a fantastic experience with the Thai massage at this place and was highly impressed with everything. The shop is conveniently located near BTS Thonglor, making it easy to visit. 	Excellent massage. Stayed at the Marriott Bangkok sukhumvit. This was right around the corner. Well designed, extremely clean, very professional. Better than all the massages I get back home in DC. I had a headache from lack of sleep and the scalp massage made it go away. My shoulders were tense from travel, and this felt wonderful. 	Great place and very professional staff. I liked the global atmosphere and the very honest pricing . Really to recommend !! 	I would highly recommend this massage place. We saw this place on the street and it looks clean and comfortable. The price is unexpectedly low compared to the service we are offered. The owner is very nice and friendly. He also recommended us the food around in Bkk. Thank you so much we will definitely come back 	First time to visit this place and I feel very impressed with the services and facilities they provided.  The masseuse was very professional and really know how to massage accordingly.  The place is very nice and so clean.  I will definitely come back again and highly recommended. 	Great place great facility, had a foot scrub and foot massage that was awesome.  Then went back for foot massage and back and shoulder massage next day. Great prices for the quality too. Would recommend 	I had the best Thai massage from Song (no.4)! She managed to release all my knots and tensions from my back and shoulders. Highly recommend this place if you want an authentic Thai massage :)
