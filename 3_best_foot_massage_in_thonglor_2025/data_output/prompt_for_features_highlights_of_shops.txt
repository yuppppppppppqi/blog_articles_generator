The interior design blends beautifully with Thai elements, creating a peaceful and calming energy throughout the space.  I was greeted by the receptionist by name before I even introduced myself‚Äînow that‚Äôs impressive. Their warm and friendly welcome made me feel well taken care of before the treatment even began.  The welcome drink was fresh and delicious, the perfect refreshment after walking in from the hot sun. Before the treatment started, everything was explained to me in detail, which really put my mind at ease.  I had a facial treatment this time, and three days later‚Ä¶ wow. My skin has never felt so radiant, smooth, and glowing.  This place is highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself with top-notch service and guaranteed quality. 	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a facial at Loft Thai Spa, Sukhumvit 38 in Bangkok, and it was truly one of the most relaxing and rejuvenating treatments I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was serene and inviting, with refreshing beverages and calming scents setting the perfect mood.  The staff was incredibly professional and attentive, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout the entire session. The facial itself was divine‚Äîmy skin was thoroughly cleansed, exfoliated, and it was feeling refreshed and glowing. The therapist‚Äôs technique was gentle yet effective, and I appreciated the extra care they took to personalize the treatment to my skin type.  I also loved the little details, like the relaxing facial, the complimentary foot massage and the warm tea and snack at the end, which made the experience feel even more luxurious. If anyone in Bangkok and looking for a top-notch spa experience, I highly recommend treating yourself to a facial here. It‚Äôs a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.	A huge thank you to the entire team at Loft Thai Spa! My friend and I had an exceptional experience. The welcome was warm, the place was peaceful, and the massages‚Ä¶ simply amazing. It was both relaxing and rejuvenating. We left feeling calm and happy. Thank you again for your professionalism and kindness. We‚Äôll definitely be back! 	Totally exquisite experience from start to finish! I felt so relaxed and happy. I am so thankful to everyone who works here üôè they helped me choose the treatments for my needs, and the therapist who treated me was wonderful, used the perfect pressure and asked for feedback, made me feel very comfortable and was very professional. I have had a lot of foot massages, as I have chronic pain, and the foot massage here is the best ever. So relaxing. I did not want to leave after treatments! I will definitely return many times before I go home üíúüëå‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you to the lovely ladies in the receptionist and to the therapist, I did not get her name but she is fantastic üòç 	Absolutely fantastic experience! The massage was incredibly relaxing and tailored to my needs, relieving tension in all the right areas. The cupping was expertly done, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. The skin treatment was also top-notch, leaving my skin glowing and refreshed. The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire session. I walked out feeling like a new person! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comprehensive and excellent wellness experience. Five stars! 	Found Loft Thai Spa based on highest Google reviews. Some personal background I am a frequent wellness spa junky back home in Kuala Lumpur.  Admittedly nothing beats my personal masseuse who rolls me out knuckles and elbow until I‚Äôm mushed. Not for the faint hearted coz it can be painful but all my kinks will disappear after each session.  So since I‚Äôm on holiday I wanted a more relax feeling but still firm. This place met my wants and needs and the atmosphere + ambience + service was a bonus.  Love the skylight architecture. We went for the Aesop Facial Spa and Lady Spa Package. After each session we were given a lovely tea pot and bite size local delicacies.  Hip hip hoorah to Roxy for being a wonderful host and patiently entertained all our questions. Will definitely return again‚ù§Ô∏è 	I had the best massage of my entire life today!  Me and my friend took very long to decide what kind of massage we want and the receptionist was very patiently waiting and askied if we needed any help.  I have sensitive skin so I asked them to show me the products they use for their facial and they were kind enough to do that.  In the end, I went with 120mins aromatherapy deep tissue oil massage with coconut oil as suggested by them for people with sensitive skin and I left the massage with supple and smooth skin!  The entire massage experience starts with interacting with knowledgeable receptionist about the massages/facial they offer and a refreshing healing butterfly pea tea and hot towel for your hands.  After that, they provide a form for you to write down your massage strength preference, area of focus/avoid. You are then brought to a cozy, dimly lit, room with a private bathroom and outdoor shower for your massage.  The masseuse here clearly has better and more professional technique, it was the right strength to release the tension and knots in my body, I fell asleep briefly because I felt so relaxed during the massage.  You are given shower gel and lotion to shower after if you want to rinse off the oils. The massage experience ends with 3 types of dessert, pandan jelly cake, pumpkin shallots cake and coconut ondeh paired with herbal tea.  Would definitely come back again to treat myself! 	Loft Thai Spa is the must-go spa in Bangkok. You cannot miss this Amazing spa. My family and I visited twice in a week since it's so relaxing and comfortable. Professional massage and service. Big Thank You to Gie and our therapists (Apple and Cherry)! Our sore bodies will miss you all! ü•∞üòÜ	Very nice and clean place. We very very good taken care of and the massage was holistic - from feet to body and head. People are extremely nice and good skilled. The only minus is a bit expensive.	My friends and I came here because of all the amazing reviews and the facility looks clean. The staff were amazing, welcoming and accommodating. We got the welcome drink and after treatment snacks and tea, but the facial was mediocre. We paid $4800 baht/person, which is equivalent to $140 usd for the hydra-facial. This is considered pricey for Thailand, so we were expecting our face to be clean and glowing afterwards, it was not. The description on their website for the hydra-facial includes ‚Äúextraction‚Äù, upon arrive we were told no manual extraction, the only ‚Äúextraction‚Äù we were getting is from the suctioning of the hydra-facial machine. The facial ‚Äúmassage‚Äù and foot bath felt more like a caress than a massage. My face felt exactly the same after, grimy with black heads and milia. I came back to the hotel and rewashed my face. For the price we paid, we would not go back for mediocre results. I rather pay a little more in America for medical grade hydra-facial where they actually cleanse and extract your pores. 	Had a lovely experience! Went for my first prenatal massage at 16 weeks and the masseuse made sure I was comfortable with sufficient pillows and checked in with me now and then. The massage was comfy with a good amount of pressure! 	It was a great experience. A little pricey but great. Would recommend the half day spa with body scrub, hot stone oil massage and facial 	What an outstanding experience. My husband and I requested the couples indulgence package. It was 3 amazing hours of truly some of the best treatments we have ever received. The esthetics of the spa are tasteful and calming and the service is 5 star quality. Worth the trip. So happy we found them. 	Great place to have a good massage, good facial and a pampering time! The Thai massage was really good and so was the facial. They serve you with a drink before the spa and snacks after. The receptionists speak very good English and reservation can be made easily though WhatsApp as well. Would recommend this place though it‚Äôs more expensive than other Thai massage places but you get a great massage that relieves your knots! 	The staffs were great! I went to treat fatigue and soreness‚Ä¶ I got to relax and alleviate almost all soreness. Great service and tea!	This spa in Bangkok is truly exceptional! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The masseuses are highly skilled, especially with their pregnancy massage techniques. They even surprised us with a thoughtful gift for our baby, showcasing their commitment to customer care. I wholeheartedly recommend this spa for anyone seeking a top-notch relaxation experience! 	Lovely spa that provides massages and spa treatments with smiles and desserts! On the expensive side but totally worth it if you want to splurge on yourself! 	I had an amazing time with their Thai compress massage program! The complementary snacks and service quality were superb. You can tell after receiving the service that their therapists here are experienced. After the massage, my shoulders and legs pains are gone. I love it. Definitely come back again for their massageüíï  Ps. I recommend you book the appointment in advance, so they can prep everything ready to serve you :) 	Roxy and kitty and Iris were incre√≠ble!!!  What a truly luxurious experience to have a half of a spa day, they made the whole transition seamless into my time in Thailand. If you are ever in Bangkok, you have to go to the Loft.!	One of the most disappointing massage experiences in Thailand. Not only is the music driving someone crazy but they place didn‚Äôt feel welcoming at all. I was left waiting 10 minutes without a drink, didn‚Äôt get a foot bath, the room was too bright and hot and the massage was way below the quality I expected. This is not worth the price at all. For a cheap corner shop massage it‚Äôs okay but not for this experience  Edit: It is clear now why their reviews are so good. After leaving the original review the place emailed me and offered a refund if I delete my comment. Since I believe in transparency that won‚Äôt happen. Clearly this is not the first time and shows that their score should be a lot lower than it currently is.

The staff are polite and provide great service. The massage therapists are skilled, and the place is clean and nicely decorated. It has all the necessary facilities, including an elevator. The restrooms are clean too.	600‡∏ø/60mins worths every baht.. Staffs are friendly profession and skilled..which u can ask for light pressure ..if u wanted to. (Thai massage is not for the weak please keep that in mind).Clean rooms and provided pillow coverage, fresh co-ords to change snacks and tea after. Convenient location.My masseur is P‚ÄôLex. 	I don't know why this place has such a good rating. We had a 90 minute foot massage at 8:30pm. The massage was not that great for the price. They told the customers who came at 9pm that they were closed. But they accepted a Chinese group at 10pm, which was the closing time. The main thing is that the massage oil was not fresh. After the massage, my husband got hives on his legs and neck and had to go to the hospital. I do not recommend this place. 	An excellent authentic Thai massage, nice atmosphere, and clean. The therapists are professional. I‚Äôm impressed with the signature Po Thai program.  My new favourite place in Thailand , worth it 	I had an exceptional experience with an authentic Thai massage in a welcoming atmosphere. The owner is highly professional, prioritizing hygiene and delivering outstanding service. I was truly impressed with the entire experience.  If you‚Äôre taking the BTS, get off at Thonglor Station, exit #3, and take a short walk to reach the location.  This is a must-visit spot when you‚Äôre in Bangkok‚Äîwell worth every penny! 	Great spot for a foot and shoulder massage if you're done with walking around the area or just need to cool down in the AC. It's the cleanest looking facility in the area, and the ladies are lovely! Highly recommend it! 	Highly recommended!!! Clean environment, and they use the famous Thai snake powder after the oil massage!!! Which is super amazing so the legs aren‚Äôt oily at all 	Song did a wonderful job! Had many massages before but she did the best! Especially right after a long flight, this was definitely necessary! Enjoyable as well! Very well priced. Everything is clean, smells great, and kind service. Would like to come back. 	Today, I discovered a massage parlor in Thonglor that truly surprised me!  I thought massage places only offered traditional services, but this one offers foot exfoliation too! ‚ú®  It felt like shedding old layers and being reborn!  Truly unique and refreshing!  #Massage #Thonglor #SelfCare #Exfoliation #SpaDay #300THBü´∞üèª ‚Ä¶ 	I massaged hopped for 4 days in Bangkok, when I finally discovered this gem! üíé. The interior is beautiful, calm, cool and quiet. My masseuse (#45), Ms. Rhaung (hopefully I remembered the spelling!), was AMAZING!  I love a STRONG massage, and she was full of the perfect strength and pressure. I had a foot scrub, foot massage, followed by a Thai massage. Ms. R, was perfect, I cannot express how grateful I was to find her and this spa. She is my favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è of all time!  Thank you for the most lovely, most wonderful, most relaxing experience!  The welcome and hospitality will not be forgotten ü™∑  	The shop is located in Thonglor, easy to travel, near BTS. The shop is quiet and the massage is very comfortable. 	Excellent! This is probably the best massage I have had. Good catching the pts and stretching. Foot massage was excellent too. Highly recommended. 	The therapist gave me one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had, especially for the shoulder and neck.  I‚Äôve been to many massage places in Bangkok before, and this place ranks up there with one of the best.  The massage shop is very clean and has a great atmosphere.  And the therapists are very professional. 	I had a fantastic experience with the Thai massage at this place and was highly impressed with everything. The shop is conveniently located near BTS Thonglor, making it easy to visit. 	Excellent massage. Stayed at the Marriott Bangkok sukhumvit. This was right around the corner. Well designed, extremely clean, very professional. Better than all the massages I get back home in DC. I had a headache from lack of sleep and the scalp massage made it go away. My shoulders were tense from travel, and this felt wonderful. 	Great place and very professional staff. I liked the global atmosphere and the very honest pricing . Really to recommend !! 	I would highly recommend this massage place. We saw this place on the street and it looks clean and comfortable. The price is unexpectedly low compared to the service we are offered. The owner is very nice and friendly. He also recommended us the food around in Bkk. Thank you so much we will definitely come back 	First time to visit this place and I feel very impressed with the services and facilities they provided.  The masseuse was very professional and really know how to massage accordingly.  The place is very nice and so clean.  I will definitely come back again and highly recommended. 	Great place great facility, had a foot scrub and foot massage that was awesome.  Then went back for foot massage and back and shoulder massage next day. Great prices for the quality too. Would recommend 	I had the best Thai massage from Song (no.4)! She managed to release all my knots and tensions from my back and shoulders. Highly recommend this place if you want an authentic Thai massage :)

Everything was good from start to finish. The massage therapists are professional and very attentive. One of the things I really appreciated was the ability to customize my experience in advance. Before the session, you fill out a form where you could choose the pressure level and specify which areas to focus on or avoid. It makes the whole experience seamless, without having to explain everything during the session. The spa itself is clean, modern, and beautifully maintained. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing‚Äîyou start unwinding the moment you step inside. There‚Äôs no rush or chaos, just pure tranquility. Highly recommended!	Relaxing vibes and nice service. The staff checked the water temperature and explained everything well. The room is clean and no any insects or bad smell.  The male staff at the front is very helpful to coordinating with the spa owner to extend the voucher expiry date which was bought directly from the spa. Appreciated. 	Very good hidden gem, massage is really good & hard strength. From head to toe. Love the onsen bath & choices of essential oil. Totally a unforgettable relaxing experience in bangkok, will visit again. They do have a off peak discount on the package at 2050baht. For 2.5hrs. 	I recently visited Forest Massage and Spa in Bangkok, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The online booking process was incredibly easy and hassle-free, making it convenient to secure an appointment. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the beautiful and serene environment, which set the tone for a truly relaxing experience.  The therapist I had was not only skilled but also very kind and gentle, making me feel completely at ease. The massage itself was wonderfully soothing, with just the right amount of pressure. Considering the quality of service and the calming atmosphere, the price is truly value for money. I highly recommend Forest Massage and Spa for anyone looking for a rejuvenating experience in Bangkok.	I had a wonderful experience at Forest Massage & Spa Onsen. The massage was very relaxing, and the specialist paid great attention to all the areas that needed care. The atmosphere was calming and professional. My only small remark is that my feet got a bit cold during the session, but it didn‚Äôt affect the overall enjoyment. Highly recommend this place for anyone seeking quality care and relaxation. 	Booked online by my fiance, we arrived a bit earlier and could start the entire process  They handed us out a small flyer so that we could show where exactly we wanted the focus to be and how soft/hard.  The onsen was really nice, really warm water and clean, you get all the needed clothes and overall very welcoming and nice setup rooms  The massages were also done well, definitely helped a few bits of my back pain.  Price wise for the location it's more or less okay, maybe a bit on the high end since the neighborhood is overall more expensive than others.  Only thing I wish they would improve:  The explanations, like when does X happen or what should we do at Y etc	Bought a package for couples, onsen + office syndrome massage. Great experience. Will visit again next time :) 	First time trying forest massage as it‚Äôs near to hotel am staying. What a gem! Excellent service and most importantly the therapist knows all the hidden spots to release the tension and knot! The place is relaxing and seems relatively new. Easy to reserve via line and prompt in reply. Highly recommended 	Great experience! The staff were all very professional and skilled. The massage was very relaxing, the therapist does not rush you, ensuring that you are enjoying every moment of the experience. I highly recommend! 	Everything was just amazing right from the entrance! That foot bath at the beginning - set the very right mood for the rest of spa time here. And the massage was exactly what I needed! Thank you for your hospitality, will definitely come again! ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	Went there yesterday for a 2hr full body aromatherapy oil massage. It was amazing overall.  My therapist was very skilled in massage and was attentive. She let me pick my oil and focused on the areas I requested. At  times the massage was a bit painful, but I felt that is because she was really getting rid of all the knots in my shoulders (which feel fantastic today), but mostly it was super relaxing. Pretty sure I fell asleep.  I have long hair, and they gave me a shower cap to cover it and prevent it getting all oily. However, after a while the elastic bad pressed into my forehead and it hurt enough to distract me from the massage. So, if you are a person with long hair, take a clip or a bobble with you to tie your hair up. 	An exceptional experience from start to finish! The service was highly professional, and the attention to detail was outstanding. This was by far the best Thai massage I‚Äôve had ‚Äî deeply relaxing yet incredibly effective. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-quality massage experience! 	Super satisfied with the service, cleanliness and convenience of this place to my hotel!  They‚Äôre available for booking on LINE and across multiple platforms such as kkday, klook, and the prices are pretty reasonable. There are also promotions which you can find on their facebook or on LINE.  My therapist Mai was really good with her hands. I felt soothed and rejuvenated after my massage. There was also a shower after for aromatherapy massages. 	A very decent place to do a massage. You have to make a booking before coming here. The place is clean and relaxing. It's not like other massage shops along Thonglor which are very crowded and untidy.  I believe they have a good booking system that avoid bunch of people flooding the shop and end up with poor massage quality. 	Relaxing onsen experience with watermelon juice. The price is reasonable and the service is great! 	I booked the A2 spa package for my partner and I, and we were both pleased with our experience with the private onsen and aromatic oil massage. We enjoyed the ambience of the massage parlour, as it was very nature-esque. Would recommend. 	Very calm and lovely place. From the reception to the massage itself, everyone was very professional, kind and welcoming. The place was clean, well designed and obviously well taken care of. I‚Äôll definitely be back soon! 	This is the best spa that I ever had in Bangkok. This spa is better than those luxury brand One. The therapist is really skillful with technique. I am a very high expectation guest , and I am super satisfied with this spa. Will defiantly come back . My therapist is NUCH 	I am absolutely delighted with the service I received and can't wait to recommend it to my friends. 	A perfect escape in the heart of Bangkok. Aromatherapy massage was expertly done - deep, soothing, and left me feeling completely refreshed. The onsen spa was serene and well-maintained, with warm, mineral-rich baths that melted away all tension. A must-visit for relaxation and rejuvenation. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶

The space is spacious, not crowded or noisy, which adds to the peaceful ambiance. The massage therapist was excellent ‚Äî attentive to every detail, including the desired pressure level, and made the whole experience deeply relaxing and soothing. The massage bed also had a built-in heating system, which kept me warm and cozy even with the air conditioning on. I felt completely at ease and even dozed off during the session. A truly restful experience! 	Very mild and relaxing foot massage, with nice drinks and snacks. Just in the same building as hotel nikko, very convenience for hotel member. The store has great environment and very less crowded. The service is nice everyone comes with smile.  purchased item: 600 for 45mins foot massage. 	Went for a package with my partner. Nice ambience and service. They collected our preference on the focus area for our massage on the tablet. However during the massage, believed our masseuses mixed up our preference and i got different focus area instead of what i indicated. That apart, the massage was still great! Will definitely go back the next time im in bangkok 	Today, I had the pleasure of using the services here and was truly impressed. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming, and the place was clean and comfortable. I felt at ease throughout my visit. I will definitely return again in the future. 	I am very appreciative of the patience and care of the therapist I had. She was extremely professional and provided everything I wanted. I encourage others to visit! 	I had the 90 minute Dream Package here. The masseuse was very skilled and applied the right amount of pressure. I even fell asleep at some point during the massage. The place is deceptively big once you enter after the entrance, is very clean and smells are very soothing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing time to try this place out. 	I am a long term regular customer for a long long term and very happy to see Let‚Äôs Relax to progress till today stage, contributors definitely a very good massage and service I received today. 	Let‚Äôs Relax Onsen & Spa Thonglor, located on the 5th floor of the Grande Centre Point Hotel, provides a serene spa experience that includes access to various onsen baths, saunas, and steam rooms. A notable highlight for guests is the complimentary mango sticky rice served after their spa treatments, which adds a delightful Thai touch to the relaxation experience Ôøº Ôøº. 	Very good massage, luxurious feel and high level of comfort. Staffs are very nice too. Highly recommend! 	I went for the back, neck and shoulder massage in the special massage chair. I was expecting a strong and powerful massage to my neck and shoulders as I have experienced before and which is the point of this chair. This was however, a very weak massage, only using hands and fingers, no elbows or any power and the chair was not adjusted properly to my body so it hurt my neck even though I asked for it to be adjusted.  Other places locally do a much better massage for the neck and shoulders despite not having the specific chair, they are also half of the price. I would say not worth it at all I feel absolutely no relief whatsoever. I feel even worse than when I came in. 	The technician is so skilled. And the environment is quite clean and comfortable. The service is also very sweet. 	We went here a couple of times. The male masseuses did a good job, but the female masseuses are not worth the high price.  The receptionists were not good, they ask you to pay first, then tell you that something you requested is not available. 	My 2nd time to Lets relax but first time to this outlet. Great ambience  n service. Therapist was good and the massage was good too. Will definitely recommend! 	Went for a back and shoulder massage absolutely loveddd it. So so relaxing, the staff was very kind and friendly. Would definitely recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è 	The massage was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience with my massage therapist as well as the environment among the place and the staff 	I always visit Let‚Äôs Relax. The environment is great, clean, comfortable, and overall an amazing experience. 	The atmosphere here is quite quiet. All the staff are very cute and easy to travel near the BTS sky train.	It was the BEST massage i have ever had. And I am a frequent massagerüôà  I ordered a "dream package" which include foot hand and head and shoulder massage. Michit my therapist had done a good job. The strengthness is just right to the point. I definitely feel relaxed after he stretching my neck.  I will definitely find Michit on my every visit to Bangkok‚ù§Ô∏è	First of all, good location. Just a few minutes walk from Thong Lo BTS station. The place was clean and peaceful. The masseur was skilful, strong and professional. I had a really good Thai massage here. It was 90 minutes and I wish I had taken a longer one. The complimentary sticky mango rice was also very good! Oh, book your slot a day in advance if you don‚Äôt want to be disappointed at the counter. 	Very comfortable and relax, definitely will come back again

Massages are super affordable - average 320 baht for 1 hour. I got a massage by both male and female masseuses and they were very professional and respectful. There is a communal effort to make both private and public massage rooms quiet so don‚Äôt feel intimidated by the sometimes crowded appearance! 	Massage was excellent. Simple massage area and not comparable to the high end massage places in BKK. Thus, price points are relatively quite reasonable. Tried the traditional and also the aroma (oil) - and not were so good. Must try! 	Had absolutely fantastic thai massage here! One of the best of all the times I've been to Thailand since 2012. Every single muscle in my body was worked on in that hour! 	My husband and I went here for the Thai massage based on other great google reviews. They do a great job of undoing the stress your body feels after days of exploring Bangkok climbing lots of stairs on the BTS etc. Great location in Thong Lor and professional and effective massage. We will be back for sure. 	Perfect Thai massage for good price, thank you! 	Absolutely wonderful massage from Sport. I wasn‚Äôt sure as the place is busy and everyone is packed in but once you are in place (and they insist on silence , creating a very peaceful atmosphere) it‚Äôs perfect. I felt so safe. I‚Äôve always requested a female masseuse in the past but felt so safe with Sport. The massage itself was 1.5 hours and did me so much good. Some pain and cracking but much needed! Highly recommend! 	Walked in for a massage and everyone there was so nice and friendly. The place is clean and smells lovely. The massage was so good and price was great. I wish I had time to come back more often. Highly recommended . 	went here for massage twice because once was not enough! my masseuse tham was so good and really one of the best foot massages ive ever had! price is very value for money too and would definitely come back in the future if im staying nearby! 	Definitely the best massage experience I ever had!!!!! Every single time of rubbing is precisely right to the pain point. I will definitely come back again! 	Definitely one of my favourite massage shops in town, been visiting here over 3 times back and forth, they always provide an excellent service when it comes to Thai massage! On top of that, the price is affordable as well! I‚Äôll surely go back again when I come to BKK the next time :) 	I asked for head&neck massage, and half of the massage was on my back ‚Ä¶ I asked meanwhile but she didn‚Äôt really respond ‚Ä¶ plus during the massage the workers constantly whispering between them which is fine if it‚Äôs occasional but for an hour you don‚Äôt want to hear your massagist don‚Äôt stop talking. Price was affordable, total Was OK, but I won‚Äôt come back 	This is a very good authentic Thai spa ! The therapist I had was skilled and delivered an amazing massage. The price is good too and reception staff is friendly.  Now my only negative comment is that it wasn‚Äôt very private. It‚Äôs a small and busy spa. There are curtains isolating you from other guests but they are very close to you and during my massage all curtains were actually open, which didn‚Äôt make me feel very comfortable.  Still think it‚Äôs a good affordable spa. 	Tried several massage in this neighborhood, this one is the BEST! Best value, most professional masters, simple but the best! Recommend to massage lover. We will definitely come back. 	We went here because it was the higher rated place compared to surrounding massage places, and they accept card. The masseuse was good in looking for knots, but would sometimes knead bones. Pressure was okay.  I got the back neck shoulder massage but it felt like a normal thai massage (200 baht cheaper than the back massage rate) with extra focus on back. I actually don't like the stretching so I didn't get a thai massage.  Also, it would have been okay but the masseuse pulled a muscle and I got injured from it. Now it's difficult to turn my head to the left. I told the receptionist about it and they just looked at me and laughed. There was no apology or asking about the injury.  Massage okay (3 star maybe for the rate) if they didn't injure me and laughed. 	One of strength is near by hotel and staff skill is very nice. especially foot and traditional thai massage. Actually i dont take aroma-massage. Sorry 	They‚Äôre always booked! Make sure to make a reservation thru LINE. In general, the therapists are above average and they work really hard! I‚Äôve been visiting here everyday with my dad while we‚Äôre staying in Bangkok.  FYI: Credit card available (3% fee excluded). 	I‚Äôve been here twice, the lady called (C or Si) is amazing, for the first time someone could crack me like this, good price also. 	Best massage I‚Äôve done. Went 2 days in a row - if there was more time I would have gone again. FYI it‚Äôs a strong pressure, I prefer it that way and thought it was great. Friendly staff and clean space too.	Good massage place, foot massage are done on massage table instead of the lazy couch so the whole leg will be well massaged. 	Massage is good with strong pressure that i like. It will be good if the privacy of the room can be improved. I was shocked when i stepped in a room and saw a man with upper body naked.

The place is fresh and super clean. The ladies so attentive and the doctors really professional with a good technique. I personally recommend deep tissue massage 60 or 90 minutes and you‚Äôre fresh and ready for your next adventure! I always get out of there felling like a million bucks! Thanks a lot for a great service, see you very soon! 	This was a terrible foot massage experience. If it were possible, I would give it a negative star rating. The person performing the massage had no skill whatsoever. Please help to ensure your staff skill quality as some is still very good but not the young guy. 	Came here twice on my trip with 4 people for foot massage. Both times the technicians were all excellent and the place is very clean. Nice music also! 	Very poor quality massage considering the price of 700 baht, I wouldn't have paid more than 50 for this level of skill. I asked the massage girl how long she had studied and she said just 1 month 	I found that it seems like a new shop and look like clean so I went into it in the morning. The reception called a masseur for me with 60 min Thai message.  It was conducted on 2/F that it‚Äôs really new and clean that I felt so comfortable. The masseur also provided good massage to me.  However, it is closed to the main road that it is not very quiet to relax.  Overall it was a decent one. 	Very good exp√©rience at Wara Massage for 1h aroma deep tissue. Staff Very Nice and shop Very clean and beautiful. I recommand it. 	Seems like a new shop. Place is new and clean, but the massage quality was a bit lackluster 	Went there a few days ago on my last day in BKK.  First 2 visits were great dont get me wrong but during the last visit, I got the 60-minutes traditional Thai massage and they arranged a relatively young, short hair masseur to me. these are the things that i didnt like:  1. For the first 15 minutes, she was playing her phone while elbowing my lower back 2. I got changed and left my bag under the bed on a wooden tray only to realise that I've lost some of the cash. (I'm not blindly accusing because it was my friend's cash and the bag was not opened at all times from our hotel at one one bangkok to wara and back to hotel). The only time the bag has left my sight was during this massage session) We didn't go back and make a fuss. Writing this to all clients to be aware of such theft not just here but everywhere. Nothing personal  It could be just one rotten apple.	Super nice service, i fall down my air pod, and went back to the shop, the staffs kept well and gave back to me, super thankful!!! 	The place is very clean and therapists are very profressional.  Probably best one  around there 	The best massage ever 	Massager K Oh is so good 	Today I chose 2 clocks neck and shoulder. The 20-year-old male technician is strong enough. This shop has the most people. 	I stayed at a hotel in Thonglor for a family trip and received a massage at Wara Massage. It was new, so it was very clean, I liked the facilities, and the people working there greeted me with a bright smile and were friendly.  And when I first went there, I remember two people working hard to clean the outside window. It looked clean inside and out.  The most important thing was that the massage was completely refreshing. The pressure was just right and I asked them to gently massage the painful area. My shoulder was very sore, but they soothed the area so well that I felt so refreshed that I went twice a day. I will go again. 	WARA Massage located across from the Thonglor Centerpoint Hotel where I spent two days. The facility was clean and seemed to be the newest facility in the area. I had a foot massage one day and a Thai massage one day. The price was good too. 	I went twice. I was satisfied with the foot massage on the first day, so I gave him a large tip and got a Thai massage the next day, but I felt like I fell asleep during the massage twice. They also gave a tip of 50 baht, but the expression on their face... It was a struggle, but I didn't go the next day. If you're going to receive it, just do it with your feet.	Under the guidance of a chubby male manager Reserve 1 hour of Thai massage (350 baht, reasonable price) They told me to wait 2 minutes, but I waited 15 minutes. Amazing Thailand. After changing into silk-like massage clothes and lying down on the somewhat narrow bed, I felt like all my fatigue was being relieved by the cozy pillow, which was nice.  A rather strong-looking older sister with yellow hair cut Although I'm not strong, I was satisfied with applying Yamong and doing my best to improve my shoulder since it hurt.  I gave this massage shop 5 points to mean that I should pay more attention to the massage shop where I felt better than the best. May you prosper.  The cost-effectiveness is awesome At this price on Thonglor Street, what do you want?^^	While staying at Center Point Thonglor, it was the cleanest and friendliest massage shop I've ever been to across the street. I went there when it was crowded and was a bit hesitated, but after getting the massage, everything immediately calmed down and it was great. I recommend it. 	While I was in Bangkok for 6 days and 5 nights, I had 2 massages per day and it was the best place I've ever been to. I was so satisfied that I gave a tip of 100 baht. 	I had a massage with Roy, the woman was excellent. I have never had a very precise person, I recommend him.

One foot massage and  two whole body massages.  The place is simple but spotless.  The masseuses are excellent and kind.  It is not a snobby place. The prices are fair.  The owner is often there with her cute golden retriever puppy.  The location is great just across from the Hotel Nikko and around the corner from Le Petite Salil Hotel.  There are many good Japanese restaurants nearby for dinner after your massage.  You can easily contact the shop using the LINE app.	Good massage at a decent store. The only thing that can be improved is washing feet before massage. Due to not washing my feet ahead of starting the massage, I felt a little bit uncomfortable(non-hygenic) during massage time.	Amazing massage. I called an hour before, walked in and chose 30 mins back and shoulder, 30 mins foot massage. I believe my masseuse‚Äôs name is Mina, she was so skilled and thorough. I have tried a few other places in thong lor, this will be my new go-to, especially because I‚Äôm a volleyball player and my legs are always sore. 	Highly recommended !  We have visited this shop 3 times in our trip .It is a clean and comfortable massage shop in thong lor. The staff are very nice and professional especially KAI and LINLY. ‚ù§Ô∏è They help me and my mum relieve our muscle pain . Will come back next time :)	Did foot massage for my first visit and Aromatherapy for my second visit. Good deal as it has promotion offers if you book online! Shopkeeper and staffs are friendly and welcoming. 	Tried body aroma massage. Two of us went there, both of our therapists were not quite skilful. 	Super nice massage place. Decent price (about 50 baht over average- but it‚Äôs 1000% worth it). You don‚Äôt really hear the noise of the busy road and you have privacy curtains, so u can relax without feeling like everyone‚Äôs staring at u. If you are looking for a relaxing foot, back, or full body massage this is the place! 	Not bad but masseuses are sleeping almost everywhere downstairs. Makes it look unprofessional. 	I been here twice,first time with mu husband we had foot massage (It was great, very relaxing great super nice staff) and second time I been myself and had neck shoulders and back massage and again it was great! Top standard,  place looks little bit run down but staff is highly capable and professional very good with their job, great prices I would say under priced for level of massage you getting from these lovely ladies ü•∞ü•∞üëåüëå 	Indulge in pure bliss as skilled hands work their magic, melting away stress and tension. Best massage and I came continuously for 2 days. The opening hours is quite late, no more worries on massage after a late night shoppingüëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	The worst massage in Thailand. My masseur was NO SKILL AT ALL and looks tired of life. Went back in 2022 after a few years. Price gone up quality gone way down. You can find better massage elsewhere. 	Excellent massage in Tong Lor. clean shop, very friendly, knowledgeable staff and helpful english speaking management that will guide you for the best experience. The therapist really helped with my muscle and joints pain 	Had a frozen shoulder. Booked 1 hour of massage. Very skillfull masseuse, the shoulder pain has gone away. Great shop, very professional and attentative. 	Well renovated location, clean place with nice staff. The massage was not good as expected. I took foot massage, it was soft and boring.	The noise from the main road can be heard I. The treatment rooms so you don‚Äôt get true peace and quiet. It‚Äôs quite clean though. 	Ket is very good skillüòç ‚Ä¶ 	Excellent massage by professional therapists. Really good value. I‚Äôll be going again! 	Very good services! Nice and make me feel very welcome! 	Very good. Phon is recommended. 	Don‚Äôt go, the girl here apparently doesn‚Äôt know how to do massage appropriately.

My first visit was a traditional Thai massage and the masseuse was very skillful. My second visit, I did half hour of foot massage & 1-hr Thai massage; the masseuse was very skillful as well. This location was clean and had a calming vibe. It is also close to Thong Lor BTS. I would go back again and recommend it. 	It's a place that many Koreans recommend, but in my personal experience, it wasn't that great. I don't think I'll go there again. 	I recently visited Dala Massage , I was really impressed. The massage was great and helped me relax, feeling very comfortable. However, there was one thing that made the experience feel less than perfect: the massage ended 5 minutes earlier than the promised time. Although it's a small detail, it did leave me a bit dissatisfied. If the shop could improve on being more punctual, it would be even better. But overall, it was still a good experience and I would consider returning. 	Enjoyed a Good foot massage there, price reasonable and it‚Äôs a nice clean cosy place as well	If you are looking for a reputable massage shop with qualified therapists, this is the right place for you. I had a 90 Minute Massage and the therapist was Mali. She immediately identified the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmy back where the problems were. I went back the next day and she treated it with a special balm. I can realy recommend Dala Massage and will come back several times. The Best massage Shop i ever visited in Bangkok. 	I‚Äòm back in Bangkok and visited Dala Massage immediately after landing. I had extreme neck pain and after several visits to the therapist Noi Na, it has now completely disappeared. Thank you for the excellent therapy. I will always come back when I‚Äôm in Bangkok. Best wishes. Olaf	Good place for those who like hard massages. The masseuse really kneaded every muscle and knot on my body and gave a good stretch. Too hard for me but it will be perfect for anyone who needs a sport massage. Clean and professional setting. 	Had a great foot massage here. Not too hard but good technique, nice and relaxing.  Only negative was a group of noisy Chinese tourists talking quite loudly in the beginning. Would be nice if the staff could point out to people if needed to keep the noise down, as it can ruin the experience for others.  Also there should not be any need for pre-tip. If the massage is good then they'll get a tip anyway, along with repeat business. By mandating a tip for booked appointments you are hurting your business as most people will look elsewhere. I've been coming to Thailand for over 10 years and have never come across this. Just saying....	Proper Thai massages at very reasonable prices. We were a group of 5 without a booking and got seen to immediately. Just be aware that typical Thai massages are quite firm! 	I love love love DALA! I have come to Thailand many times and I always go back to Dala because I know I will have excellent treatment! Always great customer service, cleanliness and friendliness. If you‚Äôre staying in ThongLor then I would suggest you check them out! ‚ò∫Ô∏è 	The service is very good and the chef is very attentive. I will come again next time. 	Not super professional therapists and massage room is to small . Staff speaking very loud with each others and dosnt shy of clients. My therapist was NO SKILL AT ALL and looks tired of life ‚Ä¶ Massage salon doesn‚Äôt looks clean . I think I waste my time . Tiger massage on same street much better 	Good place‚Ä¶ nice technique and very relaxing 	At first, you‚Äôll notice how cramped the place feels, packed with customers and with little room to spare. The massage bed takes up almost all the space in your private cubicle, leaving just enough room to settle in. But once the Thai massage begins, all those initial concerns disappear. The masseuse‚Äôs technique is vigorous, professional, and incredibly effective.  Despite the crowded environment, the experience is truly delightful. I won‚Äôt reveal the name of my masseuse because I want to keep her to myself, but she definitely deserves a medal	I‚Äôve been to Dala 20+ times and it‚Äôs always high quality massages, nice girls, clean and chilled environment, strongly recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è  I find 90 minutes thai massage + foot massage the best pampering experience  Remember to tip the therapist though cause prices are on a low side despite the great conditions and perfect service	Super recommend if u need more relaxing!! 	We had a full family foot/Thai massage here and it was lovely. The staff are so attentive Massage was excellent mix of pressure and stretching. Lighting was very dim with relaxed music in the background We couldn‚Äôt all be seated at the same time but the manager/owner made space for us in a short time. So grateful	One of the best massages that we have ever had so far! The price is right, but most importantly, the massages were right on point! The masseurs were very strong and powerful, so they could really touch  all the deep tissues and release the tension in your muscles! Both my husband and I were very happy with the quality that we came back for a second time! Highly recommend to everyone who stays nearby! 	The first one has no mood to service me because she forgot to arrange me change clothes and she kept looking outside of window while she massaging, most importantly she only gently touched my feet. I complaint her and the manager changed another for me, the second one is much better than first one. Honestly, the manager and boss both have very good attitude to settle down my complaint, but the quality of massage is not good as their attitude. 	Walked into the first shop I saw on a Friday afternoon and my 60 minute foot massage was amazing! The first 45 minutes were foot/leg massage and the last 10 minutes were a neck/shoulder/back massage. My masseuse was Mon and she was so strong! The atmosphere was really nice. The lights were dim and it was quiet with relaxing music playing in the background. Really enjoyed it here, thank you!

I go here often.  The price is more expensive than other massage shops in Thailand.  There are some massage therapists who are not very good at times, but overall I am satisfied. 	I had a great massage here. Walk in no appointment needed (but might need to make one at busier times or for groups/specific services). Across from Donki Mall and it was next to my lodging so very convenient if you‚Äôre staying in the area.  Reception spoke English and could explain their membership program. If you‚Äôre staying for a longer period may be a good option.	Service is excellent!! I booked through Class pass application for 2 hours (Foot & Thai massage) Khun Thong, the masseur, provided very polite massage and strong endurance. I do recommended the place 	Really great quality of staff considering it's a chain. Service is attentive and nice. Def recommend making a reservation before going as it's a pretty busy location. 	I booked a Head & Shoulder Massage which cost 400 Baht for 60 mins! The receptionist is polite and friendly ‚ò∫Ô∏è I waited 10 mins sitting on the couch at the lobby and I was bringing into the massage room, the massage lady is professionally doing her job üòÅ I like the service! ‚Ä¶ 	Clean, relax, comfy plc.  Good massage. 	Good professional service, water and tea free	Rude, incompetent staff (manager / administrator), maybe this problem is only in this branch, but I never got to the massage, have no desire to get relaxation here 	Got a shoulder and neck massage and it was just pathetic. She was basically just touching me. Do they just learn from YouTube videos now days? 	First impression, the lobby is very clean and well designed. I had a full body oil massage. The masseuse was very experienced  and did an awesome job taking away all the knots. My whole body felt relaxed during and after the massage. It‚Äôs well worth the money. 	Semi-rude receptionist, tried so hard to upsell massages. My masseuse was 15 mins later than the ones my companions received, and when she finally arrived she gave me the worst foot massage of my life. I basically just paid 450 baht for a foot rub. The entire hour I was just waiting for it to end. Also, I think several of the masseuses were sick, they kept coughing. Not recommended.	I really impressed with their services. I‚Äôve been the member here and always come here. Every time I came here, I try to test other massage types and it‚Äôs not disappoint me at all hahaha. Also, the salon is quite good but the hair towel a bit smelly! Hope you might solve this small issue haha. Anyway, I still recommend you guys who finding Thai massage which is a painless massage Please try this store ^^ 	This is the worst massage I have ever experienced. The lady seemed completely clueless about what she was doing, merely stroking my feet without any pressure throughout the session. When I requested more pressure, they started using excessive force, causing me pain rather than relaxation. 	I always go to Lek massage for a genuinely amazing and relaxing massage and my manicure\pedicure and hair needs. The service is 5 star. My partner and I desperately wanted a foot massage at 23:30 and I really appreciate that Lek massage thong lor managed to fit us in for two 30 min massages right before closing. Thank you very much and see you again soon 	I chose foot and hand spa Include normal nail polish.foot spa There is no disposable bag, which is unsanitary and the clerk does not provide it. We told the clerk to cancel spa only polishÔºå The clerk actually gave us all the money back and asked us to do it somewhere else. Very speechless and poor service attitude. 	If you find a therapist named Addy, you won't regret it. I got a really cool Thai massage and felt professional that I've never felt at other shops. I'm a professional trainer and I'm good at recognizing muscle movements. 	I love coming to this place. Mae Kat is amazing, every time I come in with pain in certain areas I wouldn‚Äôt tell her where it is, yet she manages to find it and massage it better. If does have a heavy grip but if you are like me (who loves tough massages) then she would be the one for you. 	Massage was ok, good pressure and good techniques. But the masseur my friend and I had kept talking and laughing for no reason. Could have been more professional and respectful while we were trying to relax and sleep. Rooms were filled with mosquitos too.	Was having shoulder issues in my right rotator cuff.  A woman named Duen did a great job with deep-tissue massage- pressure applied specifically at correct spots.  Great massage, good, clean place; I'll be back	DO NOT GET YOUR NAILS DONE HERE. My gel manicure lifted in a couple of days and the cuticle was prepped well. Got a pedicure done as well but you have to pay extra to scrape the dead skin off your feet (which is a first it‚Äôs usually included) but the base of my feet was still flaky and wasn‚Äôt smooth.

Masseuses professional and great skills! Friendly and clean spa! I been back many times when visit Bkk . 	Great massage place ! Very kind staff and clean place. The message I got really helped with my shoulders and back which was hurting for quite a while. Very thankful.  I will def visit them again when in town.	Requested for 90 mins. Only got 80mins with no technique, just rubbing Staff requested for tips (??) Shouldn‚Äôt tips be given willingly by customers? Loud noise from the roads. Masseuse couldn‚Äôt wait to finish their job. They wash customer‚Äôs legs in front of other resting customers. Quite annoying  Anyway won‚Äôt recommend.	After seeing all the negatives comments here I wanted to add mine as I had a great experience ‚ú® Had to explain a little how I wanted my foot massage, back/shoulder was very good. Staff is nice. 	I know.  It depends on the person doing the massage.  My massage therapist today was not very good.  She  just  rubbed. 	Very nice place for massage and the service is very good Hi recommend for this shop.üëçüèªüëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	The Tap session ruined the experience. I hope it can just add the tip fee to the menu, not asking 100 baht for a tip after a massage.  And the craziest thing is after I gave 40 baht as a tip, not 100 baht, the manager looked so unpleasant and annoyed, I don‚Äôt mind offering more for the tip but at least train the skill better first!  It‚Äôs gross	Had a visit recently after tiresome work, Had Oil massage by masseur name ‚ÄúPad Thai‚Äù Very friendly and considerate as I told her my calve hurt just before the massage. She remembered and always go softly around the area. The oil is very aromatic and soothing my nerves. She did thoroughly especially my back presuming I visited with my office attire , helping my office syndromes.  I would recommend for everyone, but in my case as a local, the price is alittle higher than other shop in the same areas.	Nice and clean, very professional staff 	Amazing quality of massages. Very hospitable manager and happy staff. Been back twice and both experiences were world class. 	If you are looking for a leg rub instead of foot massage, this is the place. Went to about 20 massage places over the years in Bangkok, easily the worst foot massage I‚Äôve got. No technique, no strength. The masseuse never even touched bottom of my feet, pure leg menthol lotion rub. Waste of my money and time. 	I went there for a 90mins aromatherapy in the afternoon. Did not need booking in advance. Friendly staff but the place under renovation with noise.  The musseur isn‚Äôt very focused when she did the massage. They talk with each other and I didn‚Äôt see any skills from her massage, only rubbing my body with oil.  Disappointed experience	Honestly, one of the worse massages I have had in Thailand! Masseuse talking extremely loud, coupled with a poor massage. I couldn‚Äôt wait till it was over. Literally went for a proper massage straight after. Do not recommend but nuch massage is the best! Will never return! 	Convenient massage shop near where we live. Clean and friendly. Very satisfying! 	Great foot massage, good value and friendly 	Very good massage. Nice place. Nice people 	One of the worst massages I‚Äôve had in Thailand. Very disappointing. My therapist basically just rubbed without much technique and skill. 	I got massage everyday when I visit Bangkok, sometimes even twice a day. This place cheating time for sure! I pay an hour, and the lady only did 50 mins (I clock the time). I tell the lady that she should do 10 more mins till an hour. But she just be laughing, and did 3 more mins only. It‚Äôs my first time visiting a ‚ÄúDISHONEST‚Äùmassage store. Shame one you. So I didn‚Äôt tip her.	The skill wasn't good like it was just rubbing you with their elbow, we booked for an hour and it was only 50 mins included the time that they asked us to take two showers. The worse thing is they asked you to tip them when you‚Äôre naked and refused to settle it later after you put your clothes back. 	Ok, so went here based on a few reviews with my gf. I opted for the oil massage and gf just a foot massage. I was taken to the top floor where there was a shower and two beds. Now when you see a shower you think something is different as to the service. The girl was sweet and strong. When I received no shorts and was basically naked, I felt well this is strange.  Half way through the massage she was getting really close and finally asked me if I wanted a massage down there ü¶¥ I politely declined. I would go again because the girl gave a good massage, but not expecting that from a massage place in this area. ü§£
