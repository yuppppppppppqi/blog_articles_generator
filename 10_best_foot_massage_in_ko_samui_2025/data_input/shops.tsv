I had a full body lemongrass massage and it was a super relaxing experience. The staff were very professional and friendly! I would totally recommend this experience to anyone, a little more expensive than some of the others but worth every Baht üíô ‚Ä¶ 	Great massage at a very good price. Came on a rainy afternoon and even though they were busy they fit us straight in for a couples massage. The view from the room is really good! 	The best massage in Koh Samui Mr.Kai was very welcoming and so friendly ü§ç I was so fresh after fully body oils massage üòç ‚Ä¶ 	Clean and nice ambience. Friendly and professional masseur. Well maintained furniture. Reasonable price. 	I've never had a massage before this but now the bar is impossibly high for everyone else. I got a couples body scrub and massage with my husband on our honeymoon at Urban Thai Massage and it was such a good experience. It was calming and the view from the room was beautiful. The ladies were funny and inviting and I swear I walked out feeling brand new. Would 1000% recommend! 	We had many massages in Thailand, probably hundreds‚Ä¶the foot massage at Urban was easily one of the best ones! The place is clean and the staff is very friendly and super professional. I‚Äôd warmly recommend paying the extra to try this place out. 	We booked the 2-hour Urban Dream treatment for 1,500 Baht each, expecting a high-level experience. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. Our therapists were very bad, painful and not nice at all. That didn‚Äôt agree even to turn off the air conditioning even though I was freezing. They were acting like they were doing me a favor for giving us the massage, and seemed unprofessional. We left feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied. 	Truly professional, very clean and tranquil setting. Nong & Tu were exceptional!! My sister and I had a shared room with a great sea view. We found it courteous that they didn't speak to each other during the massage. Highly recommended!! 	Urban Thai Fisherman Village is a pristine and picturesque location that creates a serene atmosphere for a spa experience. The cleanliness and beauty of the place are certainly notable, contributing to a sense of tranquility upon arrival. However, the experience took a downturn when it came to the core aspect of the visit‚Äî the massage therapy.  The skills of the therapists at Urban Thai Fisherman Village unfortunately did not live up to expectations. Despite numerous requests to increase the pressure during the massage, it seemed that the therapist was unable to provide the desired level of intensity. This resulted in a massage experience that felt more like a superficial rub than a therapeutic treatment, failing to address the intended purpose of relaxation and relief.  Moreover, the sequence of treatments added to the disappointment. A scrub before the massage can be a beneficial prelude to relaxation, but the lack of a towel provided before the shower detracted from the overall experience. Attention to these details is crucial in ensuring a seamless and comfortable transition between treatments.  It is evident that the therapist's skills did not meet the standard expected of a top-tier spa, leaving much to be desired in terms of the massage experience. Given the abundance of alternative choices on the island, it is hard to ignore the fact that there are far better places with therapists showcasing superior abilities.  Ultimately, while the ambiance and ambiance of Urban Thai Fisherman Village are commendable, the mediocrity of the massage therapy and the lack of attention to essential details make it difficult to recommend this establishment as a top choice for a rejuvenating spa experience. 	Great atmosphere, beautiful when you book the room with sea view, great massage and fair prices. My masseuse was Laura and she was amazing !! 	Very nice views from the rooms onto the ocean and also clean. But the lady never asked me about how intense I would like the massage and even when I told her I‚Äòd prefer it softer, it was still too hard for my taste. 	I was a little wary going into any old establishment and wanted to choose one that looked clean and professional, not just cheap. Urban Thai was very clean. We were welcomed in, got our feet washed and given slides to wear whilst inside. We were greeted nicely and treated politely throughout. My husband and I went twice and got the relaxation package with half hour foot massage and one hour full body massage with oils. I didn‚Äôt feel like she got the places on my feet that I like. Never touched the toes and somewhat avoided the heel which are the two spots I like massaged on the feet. It was still very relaxing and enjoyable and the full body massage was great. We both enjoyed the two massages we got and would recommend Urban Thai massage if you‚Äôre in the area. 	My wife and I were looking for a massage and we walked along the street in fisherman‚Äôs village. A good friend of our recommended the views and the massage therapists were amazing! We were very impressed with the couples oil aromatherapy massage we came back to get another one. Lovely facility and the view from the rooms are absolutely amazing! We will definitely come back when we are in samui again :) 	Had one of my better massage experiences in Thailand at this place! Very clean, calm, serene and nicely decorated. Friendly staff and some rooms also have a beautiful view (which you can‚Äôt see with your head down ^^). I chose the back/shoulder/neck massage with lemongrass oil. She (‚ÄòNee‚Äô) was able to exactly pinpoint which muscles needed more attention, since some around my shoulders are usually very stiff. She alleviated the ache and stiffness and overall I had a really pleasant, relaxing and satisfied experience üôèüèª 	Had a great experience with the 60-minute tiger balm Thai massage. The staff were friendly and kindly asked if I was comfortable with a male masseuse. The massage was excellent and fairly priced. No complaints! 	Nice people and best massage! Also the room with sea view is so nice, you can take a shower afterwards. 	When you pick back and shoulders massage you need lay on the floor like at those cheap massages on the beach even when they have empty many massage bed upstairs and fancy building when you pay premium ( I would understand if the place was full, but at the time there was almost nobody. So if you want to have real massage on the table like a human being you need to pick a massage that you dont want. Not talking it was soft and the lady was doing same move for 40 minutes. You cant get better treatment and for lower price elsewhere 	Fantastic experience, super clean, smells good and professional. I can highly recommend that place, my therapist for the day was ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù, he gave me an excellent foot massage. super strong hands and very gentle at the same time. 	Very beautiful, clean and quiet place. The staff are very nice and the massage was especially good. We will definitely come back. 	We had a nice massage there.  My daughter and wife enjoyed foot massage and I did a full body massage. The view from the massage room facing the sea is fantastic!

I had the most amazing eyelash extensions done at Eve‚Äôs Boudoir, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Jenny was amazing. The attention to detail was impeccable‚Äîlightweight, natural-looking. The process was relaxing, and the staff was incredibly professional and gentle. My lashes look full, fluffy, and effortlessly glamorous!  If you‚Äôre looking for high-quality lash extensions in Samui, this is the place to go. Highly recommended! üíï‚ú®  This was my second visit to Eve‚Äôs Boudoir, and once again, it did not disappoint! Nim is truly amazing‚Äîher massage technique worked wonders on my stressed shoulders, leaving me feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I highly recommend booking a session with Nim. Can‚Äôt wait to return! üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® 	We came as a family and the service at Eve's Boudoir was impeccable. My wife and daughter had a manicure and foot massages whilst I was having an aromatic oil massage. Special kudos to Nina, Mod and Itim for the great massages and to Beauty for her 1st class manicure. We will be coming back during our stay in Koh Samui. 	I had an absolutely incredible massage experience that exceeded all expectations. From the moment I arrived, everything was tailored perfectly to my preferences ‚Äî the pressure, the technique, and the overall pace of the treatment. The atmosphere was serene and calming, with a quiet, almost meditative ambiance that helped me completely disconnect from daily stress. . Special thanks to I-Tim, my therapist, who was not only highly skilled but also warm, attentive, and respectful throughout. Her intuitive touch and professionalism made all the difference.  Highly recommended for anyone in need of true relaxation and personalized care. 	Lee gave the best massage I‚Äôve had in Thailand. I chose the aroma oil massage and it was worth it. She worked on my tension and knots and it was also very relaxing 	What a great salon! I had the best Mani Pedi done by the lovely Beauty, she did such a professional job and I definitely recommend! 6 stars! 	Excellent massage by Nee Ging. We got a hot stone massage and it was so relaxing! An amazing place. 	I had a great experience with the Thai massage! The massage was very professional and effective. Therapist Nee did an excellent job ‚Äì her technique was outstanding, and she targeted all the right pressure points. I felt wonderfully relaxed and refreshed afterward. Highly recommended! 	Wonderful massage. My husband had lee and Nee for a 4 hands massage and I had Pailin for a leg and foot massage. They were all great! We had the last one from 10pm as they close at 11pm. Very clean and the manicure and pedicures look great too. White leather chairs and beds upstairs for massages. Great pressure too. 	Me and my friends had a great time at this place! We got a foot massage and some shoulders massage! Lee, Itim and Nina were amazing! Will definitely be back, they also serve you some ginger tea after the treatment!  Went back to get my nails done by Beauty! She‚Äôs amazing! 	Would highly recommend Eves boudoir. I was served by Beauty. Lovely gel manicure. Very professional and clean with AC. Nice to have a towel and water before hand and a tea afterwards. Will be returning for massage. 	Had a great experience with Beauty! She was kind, professional, and paid attention to every detail. The salon was very clean, and there were so many beautiful colors to choose from. My nails look amazing ‚Äî highly recommend! 	My daughter and I had an amazing experience at Eve‚Äôs Boudoir today. The service was exceptional. My daughter got her perfect manicure and pedicure by KT who was so great, thorough and kind. I had an absolute wonderful massage by Nim who really understood my problem areas and I felt very comfortable with her and I could really feel her kindness. We will definitely come back. 	The whole experience has just been amazing here. From the way I was welcomed with a foot wash before entering to the way I left with such a full heart. The staff is absolutely amazing here. I had my lashes done with beauty and I am absolutely so happy with it! Thank you to the team here for such a wonderful experience ü§çüôèüèΩ ‚Ä¶ 	One word: exceptional! My friend and I chose different packages, and we were absolutely delighted with this unique experience. We opted for two "Thai Steam Herbs," with a scrub for my wife and a Thai massage for me.  By the next day, my slight cold had completely disappeared, proof of the quality of the treatments. The Thai massage was simply sublime‚Äîso delicate and relaxing that I completely unwound‚Ä¶ and even fell asleep!  As for my wife, she loved her mango scrub. Her skin was incredibly soft afterward. A special touch that stood out: they use banana leaves to wrap the body, a natural and elegant alternative to the cellophane typically used in Europe.  Another noteworthy detail: a secure locker is provided to store your jewelry and personal belongings, which inspires great trust.  In short, an unforgettable moment that I highly recommend. This salon deserves more than five stars! 	Very good massage recommend massager lee and Pailin,Nice and clean place good service very good price ü•∞üëçüèª & friendly staff üëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	Excellent experience! I was really afraid to have my eyelashes extensions done here, but Beauty did a wonderful and quick job! Also my mom got here nails done here day before and told that the service and quality is wonderful here! Agree 100% ü•∞ PS! Make sure to book an appointment if you want eyelashes, you may not get a time right away and just walk in üòú 	Beauty was so great incredible pedicure service was welcoming and kind and good price. Highly recommend. I also went back again for a sauna, scrub and oil massage by Nee. The most relaxing experience. Very professional, gentle and attentive. Very very good. Would highly recommend 	Wonderful experience. You get a nice little foot scrub on the way in, you also get to choose which scented oil you want used in your massage,  you are then given cold water and a fresh cold towel. Me and my partner did the 90 minute full body and I would highly recommend it. We came out to a lovely cup of ginger tea at the end. Definitely worth a visit. 	I was very pleased with my manicure and pedicure. I highly recommend the salon. Special thanks to Lee Beauty and Apple. 	Visited here for nails and massage. Impressed by the detail of the manicure by beauty, had a great massage with Lee and Nim for my partner and I. Next time we‚Äôre here we‚Äôll come back. The prices are very good and the place extremely clean. Lovely service with some complimentary water, cold towel and tea post treatment. Thank you!

After getting a massage, I felt much better. The staff are true professionals, especially Noi. This is the most thorough and high-quality massage I‚Äôve had in Thailand. Highly recommend! 	Rin was amazing.  She gave me the best massage ever.  Deep tissue 90 minutes, so good I went back twice.  Thankyou Rin.  You are very skilled and caring. I highly recommend Rin‚Äôs services.  My two sisters, Ruth and Lee, also had a massage. They will be leaving separate reviews.  Many thanks Valerie xx 	I loved the massage it was really good and it was an amazing experience. This massage is my favourite massage i ever had. The workers were really kind.üíï ‚Ä¶ 	Absolutely amazing!!!! I got the Thai + aroma and my partner got the hot oil massage. Absolutely incredible. The best massage we‚Äôve had in Thailand. The masters and really skilled and applies amazing pressure and techniques. Very clean and modern place. Super professional and wonderful. Very relaxed!! Highly recommend. 	Great massage! I took the foot massage and my wife took the oiled Thai massage, we both liked it so much. We were next to each other although it was not the same massage type, what made the experience even better üòÑ ‚Ä¶ 	What a great massage!! I had Nui as my masseuse, she was absolutely amazing!! She got all the pressure points at the same time it was relaxing. I highly recommend this massage place. 	Our first Thai massage in Thailand at Nakee was a great experience. We felt very well taken care of by the team and really enjoyed the massage. We booked the 90-minute traditional Thai massage and now feel completely relaxed and refreshed. We‚Äôd be happy to come back again in the next few days. 	Had a great massage really lovely lady and she had a lot to deal with bless her! I had huge knots in my shoulders and they are gone! Will definitely go back ‚Ä¶. Thank you 	I‚Äôm suspicious of these 5 star reviews. This was the most low effort and low quality massage and it‚Äôs clear the therapists have no training whatsoever despite all the certificates plastered on the walls. My partner and I had a 60 min head massage and it was awful. No technique, just some repeated scratching here and there. And we had to put our head in their lap. Weird and uncomfortable.  The atmosphere was also not good. Lots of coughing and too many people squeezed into a small space. 	I had the oil massage for 2 hours and it was really amazing! The lady made me feel like a princess, the way she massaged me it was so smooth and soft then i felt asleep and felt like reborn again! Totally worth the price and every one there were so polite! 	Very nice and clean salon. And most inportant: Great massage! One of the best I ever had. I will certainly vome back here. . 	Booked a 90 minutes oil massage together with my husband. I had a really great massage and would give it a five star. However my husband had to tell his massage therapist twice that he didn‚Äôt want his private parts touched. Just a disgusting experience. 	Very nice place for a relaxing time!! We went there two times and each was better than the last. Mickey was an excellent masseuse. Everyone there is super helpful, the place is clean and they enjoy tending to you. 	Had a Perfect Thai foot massage! Everything is very clean and quiet, very friendly and the massage very good, they did upper leg as well and a little bis of shoulders in the end which was amazing! Definitely recommend 	We go there often as a couple and it's always great :) the therapist are attentive, make an effort and are really good at what they do! Prices are absolutely fair	Had the best massage with Noi! She catered the massage for pregnancy and this was by far the best massage I‚Äôve ever received even compared to 5 star hotel massages. Would highly recommend! 	I had a neck and back massage with Rin. She is really fabulous. Very kind, always asked if the pressure is ok and she did a very good job. I always have a lot of pain in my neck and right now I feel really relaxed and have no more pain. Thank you for one of the best massages I had so far. üòä If you go there ask for Rin. üòâ ‚Ä¶	I have had massages with Khun SA on several occasions now, she truly understands my needs and works on my problem-areas, she is so caring and professional. I can truly recommend both Nakee and Khun SA to anyone. 	Best massage since i‚Äòve been to Thailand! Patch and Toy were so nice, very professional and did an excellent job on our massage. My husband and I felt very relaxed afterwards. 100% reccomend! The ladies were all very kind and the studio was clean and quite. Perfect ambiente. 	Me and my wife had two massages at their location. And we would have gone for more sessions if we had more time. Noi and Pet were superb! We had two massages back in Pucket and by far, it was better at Nakee in Koh Samui. Definitely recommended it you either want a more traditional Thai massage or a more relaxed one.

Really good service, comfortable massage and yummy ginger tea and a bottle of water after the massage. The owner even helped us buy street food in front of the door! Also, the interior design is refreshing and bright - not as dark as some other places. Would 100% recommend! 	Deep thai massage seemed to be very popular so we gave it a shot as well. We were amazed. Very calming, but deep massage into tense muscles. Ning, the owner was my masseuse and she was amazing! The place is recently renovated and everything is very clean. They cleaned quickly after we finished, which gave me such a confidence it‚Äôs a proper place. At the end we were served with some fruits, water, biscuits and warm ginger tea. It was a delight! üíõ Proper real massage! Recomand this place! 	Really great massage, attitude, thoughtful staff and lovely owner! The building is beautiful, the atmosphere is so relaxing, and they serve delicious ginger tea. Now we get massages here all the time! 	Ning's has consistently provided the BEST massages we have ever received in Thailand or the UK. This is an absolute MUST visit. We schedule in a stop here whenever we travel through Koh Samui. The Thai Oil 1.5hour massage cost 700bht= ¬£15. It was insanely good and my body feels so relaxed. Complimentary water and ginger tea are provided for you.  Ning has expanded to the upstairs unit too which means there is so much more capacity and space than before. Aircon units keep you cool whilst the colourful fabrics (also for sale 200bht=¬£4.30) keep you from the chill. The parlour always smells amazing and the gentle music aids in your relaxation.  Ning has created such a lovely, super clean atmosphere and you always feel like friends. This was our third visit and we have already booked a fourth. Please support this fantastic business as you will not be sorryü©µ 	It was my second time yesterday and I had 1 hour full body massage and it has been a wonderful experience!  Biew is such a talented masseuse. I was so impressed and left feeling incredibly relaxed. I will definitely be booking more treatments with her.  It‚Äôs a lovely place, few staff but everyone is professional and friendly. We felt comfortable immediately for the first time I went with my partner and the massage relaxed me a lot! We‚Äôll be back for sure! 	Excellent place! One of the best in Samui. We came a few times and it was great time after time. The design is really nice (they have a second floor that you can't see from the entrance), and they service is professional. 	Great massage place!  Had no trouble booking via WhatsApp. We enjoyed a Thai massage, which was deeply relaxing!  Professional and smiley ladies, and a great & very important detail - you can put your belongings under the massage table where you see them through the head-spot! (At least until you rotate to your back ;))	First class spa . Beautifully appointed . Relaxing atmosphere. Cleaned to a very high standard. Staff are well trained and very attentive. This is my wife Louise's 11 th massage in 9 weeks . Can't wait to come back next year ! Thank you Ning and staff . 	What a beautiful place with European, Greek decor. Very boho chic. Extremely clean, superb massage just amazing‚Ä¶ my back which was hurting was healed! And really great experience of both the foot massages (we requested last ten minutes for the shoulder back and head). Everything was amazing. Must visit! 	#Don't waste your money or time, just go to another place. This was the worst foot massage experience I've ever had. The female therapist, who was tiny with long braids on both sides, didn‚Äôt even have the focus to do the massage properly. It was supposed to be a foot massage, but she never touched my feet. She only massaged my calves. When I asked her to focus on my ankles, she only massaged the area around my ankle bone ( lateral malleolus) . Ugh, I couldn't take it. To the owner, you need to make sure your staff can actually do the massage. Please, have this therapist retrained. 	The absolute best massage in the whole of Thailand. Extremely high standard!  I chose a 1 hour back and shoulder massage for 350 baht. The lady was highly skilled and extremely qualified.  After one minute she knew exactly where my problem areas were and targeted them accordingly. The massage was very firm and strong in the right areas (exactly as I requested).  I will recommend this place to everyone I know and I wish I lived closer!  * my boyfriend wished the foot massage focused more on the foot and less on the leg * shop is quite small but it‚Äôs Thailand after all 	Not a good experience, on arrival I was greeted by a woman with the worst look on her face. She looked at me like I stole her last dollar. Then the owner tried numerous times to upsell a much more expensive massage than I asked for which was a clear cash grab. I still proceeded, was taken upstairs by the lady with very bad attitude and exuding bad energy which is not wanted when trying to relax(whole idea of a massage) I then tried to explain where to massage 5 times but couldn't communicate in any English so I cut massage short before starting.  I then tried to explain to owner why and got more bad attitude and bad energy.. NO THANKS 	The only salon that charges same as all streets salons, but level is wow , they give you tea and banana, you select aroma oil - proper Spa for 400 ! Call in advance as they always busy! Enjoy üíì ‚Ä¶ 	The staff were pure brilliant - friendly an' welcomin'. The massages were amazin' too We went five times on our trip 'cause they were that good. Relaxin' music an' a clean, professional place. If ye want a quality massage, check them out. They'll sort oot yer knots an' have ye feelin' great. 	I had a wonderful experience at Ning‚Äôs Home Massage. As I was rushing for a flight, Ning was lovely and accommodated my request for an early massage before the store‚Äôs official opening hours. She even used premium coconut oils and had a delightful selection of ginger tea and food for me after the massage. This homegrown business deserves everyone‚Äôs support! Definitely will come back in future‚ù§Ô∏è 	I have been visiting Ning's home massage for 4 times in my first holiday in Ko Samui. The ladies are the nicest and make you feel at home right away. The massages here are the best and most relaxing. The place is clean and nicely decorated. Very calming and relaxing. Too bad I have to go. I will definitely come back if I am in Koh Samui. Thanks ladies for everything and hope to visit you again in the future! Bless you. 	Nadia is amazing I've been back twice, every time she knows just how strong each body part needs, she finds all the little areas that need attention. The best massage EVER. 	I was so disappointed by massage. I took sport massage (which is the most expensive) for 1.5 hours and the service was very bad in quality. Massage was not professional and not comprehensive. The pressure and techniques were inconsistent, as if the therapist was inexperienced in sports massage, so she just caused discomfort throughout.  I couldn‚Äôt normally communicate with specialist because she didn‚Äôt understand English. The only thing I could do is to ask her to switch to a more gentle massage to reduce the discomfort. As a result, the service ended up being a relaxing massage (but still very poor) rather than the deep, muscle-focused sports massage I paid for.  I feel very sad and disappointed. Instead of relieving muscle tension I was hoping for, the session left me feeling more discomfort than when I arrived.  The studio suggested me to come again for the same price. 	Shania‚Äôs thai massage with oil was excellent. My husband got back and neck massage and it was quite good also. The place is clean and refreshing. If you stay nearby you should definitely try here. 	We had an amazing 1-Hour Thai Massage. Loved the atmosphere and kindness of everyone. Will definitely come again!

The quality was excellent, and they put in a great effort. We've been to many massage places before, but this one is the best. 	I‚Äôve had over 15 massages at various places all across Thailand over the past month, and Sodsai Health Massage Branch 2 is by far the best! The staff is incredibly professional and attentive, making sure to tailor the massage to my specific needs. The therapist truly knew what they were doing, combining traditional Thai techniques with just the right amount of pressure. I left feeling completely relaxed. If you‚Äôre in the area, this place is a must-visit for an unforgettable massage experience! Highly recommend! 	Wonderful healing place and the ladies has doctors skills - you can do relaxing massage or fix your health issues with physiotherapy treatments - truly recommend üëç And big thank you to all the ladies there - tomorrow will be my 5th time there üôÇ 	I spent more than three months in Phuket and Samui in total. I'm sure my friends and I tried every type of massage available. This place was truly amazing! All the massage therapists were professional, skilled, and polite. I haven‚Äôt seen any massage parlor in Samui as good as this one. Their prices might be 50 baht higher for some services, but their work was so good that we even tipped the therapists. 	I had an absolutely incredible massage here! As a four-month pregnant woman, I requested a light and relaxing full-body massage, and it was beyond perfect. The therapist used positions specifically tailored for pregnancy, making me feel completely comfortable and at ease. It was so soothing and relaxing, I can't wait to come back! Definitely one of the best massages I've ever had! 	The best massage experience I‚Äòve ever had. I got an oil massage with my boyfriend for an hour. I feel absolutely relaxed physically. The massage felt amazing and covered my whole body from head to toe. It never hurt or was uncomfortable.  I‚Äòd love to come back for sure! We also got some hot tea served in the end which I‚Äòve never received in Thailand before.  Very friendly staff that understood english which was important since my boyfriend had a slight injury on his back and needed a more gentle treatment there. 	Wow!!! Amazing massage. My bf and I had the head, back, neck, and shoulders massage at the same time and all I can say is wow. EXCEPTIONAL. It felt like, Thai massage, deep tissue, relaxation, and chiropractic all at the same time. Would highly recommend this place. Just relax and let them take care of you. 	This was by far the best sports massage I ever had. I was so sore and knotted up from lifting weight and Muay Thai. This is the place to come my people. Lovely staff even got treated to a cut of tea at the end :) 	Great massage. I had deep Thai massage and it was amazing. Incredible set of techniques the masseuse used. I felt like a feather after the session. Best massage I had in Thailand, for sure. 	This was our favourite massage in Koh Samui! So good we went back everyday for 6 days! Clean, friendly, welcoming, experienced massage ladies. I can‚Äôt  recommend enough how incredible they were at Sodsai Health 2. 100% recommend. We had Nana and Penu ! Fabulous find on the island. 	So friendly and one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had! Really good pricing too. Highly recommend. 	The masseuse (Pen) is the best. Highly recommended for females. She helped me to relax my swollen calf, back and shoulder after a long day walk. I did foot oil + Tai back twice. They were prefect. 	The best massage I have had on this trip. I took an oil massage and told her that I wanted a little extra focus on my feet, and she really did. Good pressure without it being uncomfortable hard. A hole for your face which I like, and they also had what looked like very comfy chairs for foot massage. And I got some tea to relax after the massage. 	I had an amazing massage here, the masseuse did exactly what I asked for. I went in with back/ shoulder pain and was quite surprised that after the massage, the pain had disappeared. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a massage in Koh Samui! 	The massage was performed with great professionalism and attention to detail. The therapist clearly knew the techniques well and adjusted the pressure precisely to suit my needs. As a result, I felt relaxed and rejuvenated. The atmosphere was pleasant, and the whole process took place in a calm and soothing environment. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to refresh both body and mind. Highly recommended! 	Me and my friend had 5 times massage at this salon and enjoy that a lot. Professionals are work here, I would recommend Li who has strong but gentle hands üôå I loved the experience with a deep oil massage, highly recommend to visit. ‚Ä¶ 	By far the BEST massage I had in Thailand - (and I had one every day during my stay). This is the place you want to go if you are after REAL traditional Tha√Ø massages. The pressions and stretches are very precise and well done. The relaxation feeling after it is incredible . You can tell that the women have a lot of experience and knowledge. 	Excellent service and massage! I took a Thai massage and my boyfriend a deep massage, highly recommended! The ladies are so nice and kind and you can feel they are very attentive at your body and its capacities in order to adapt‚Ä¶very well done. üëçüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Excellent massage with well maintained and clean interior, and nicely airconditioned. The massage was engaged professionally and on point with the pressure without straining relaxation. Had a relaxing back and shoulder massage, and it was a big help relieving the stiffness. All staff and masseuse are accommodating and helpful with all the recommendations and massage strength request. Nice hot cup of tea for refreshment after the massage. This place really does it well, kudos! 	This is the place can relax your body and let you feel refreshed. Nice shop for massage in bangrak  .they are very professional massage and good price .I almost go to 1 times a week .highly recommend in samui

Went there for a foot massage and it was so good I had to go back for a body massage. The Deep Thai massage was amazing- very strong but left me feeling much looser and relaxed. Ladies there are lovely, with strong hands and on point technique.  Far better than some of the big shiny places nearby, I highly recommend if you want a proper massage. Would be going back again if I had the time! 	Wonderful massage! Husband and I have tried out multiple spas over our time here and we keep coming back to Sea-Sand. It‚Äôs relaxing and quiet like a spa should be. The workers are quiet and respectful and aren‚Äôt talking with each other the whole time. Not to mention the massages are the best. Strong hands and they actually seem to know what they are doing! Would highly recommend! 	One of the best massages I had. Had a great therapeutic effect and unbelievable relaxation. I had many massages in Asia, but it's far not always you get this deep feeling of really qualitative massage. Besides the place is nice and clean, and the room temperature is perfectly relaxing without air conditioning blowing on you like in the most places 	This is one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had in Thailand.  Ve did a deep oil massage and she did it with amazing effort and very attentively.  I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but for this place, I had to give a 10/10!  Lovely staff too. Thankyou! üôè 	We read the reviews and decided to go for a massage with my wife. We were very pleased and came back 2 more times. I recommend a deep Thai massage lasting 90 minutes. 	The best massage of my life!!  I had a bad shoulder, so wanted to get a massage in the hopes it would help. After looking up the reviews on Google, I found this place. And I‚Äôm super happy I did.  From the first few moments i knew it was going to be good, when she found the first knot and set to work. The following 55 minutes was spent getting rid of all the other knots which instantly felt amazing!  The woman that did it was strong enough to push and squeeze all the pain away.  Every time I thought oh i wish she would apply pressure here or there within seconds she was doing it without me mentioning what i was thinking!  I have had problems with my shoulder for quite a while and within one massage it started to feel better!  I went back everyday i was in koh samui and already miss it!  Thank you so much! 	I had the best massage experience in my life. I visited all asian countries and honestly this was the best one I had. Patty soooo cute and her skills amazing. I took 1 hour massage, was my best 1 hour in my life :) Definitely will go again. Thank you Patty, you are nice :) 	In two months on Samui I have been here 6 times, and many times in other massage parlors. Sea sand is one of the best massage places on the island. I have tried here different massages, different masseuses, they are always attentive and diligent in doing the massage. Big thanks ü´∂ 	There is no need to look for another place for Thai massage. Patty is a great masseur, she relieved a different pain with each touch. I will definitely go again. I highly recommend it :) 	Good massage. Clean. My husband and I went twice and all 4 masseuses were great, good effort put into the massage with care. He liked Patty, he said at the end of the massage she gave a great head/scalp massage.  Definitely try this spot! 	Possibly the best out of the few massage spots i been to in Koh Samui. Very kind staff and lovely service. Me and my 2 friends came for foot massage then we came back again for full body coconut oil massage. i fully recommend it. Shout out to peng, patti and tik ü´∂üèæ ‚Ä¶ 	Sea-Sand is the best massage shop I've ever been to. The place very clean, staff and owner are very skilled and friendly. I get relaxed every time I come here. And will come many times for sure 	We had a 1h foot massage here at our last day on Samui. And that‚Äòs the only thing we regret: that it was our last day! The location is perfect, the interior very lovely and cozy and the staff is absolutely kind and it is very easy to communicate in English. They respected and took care of my husband‚Äòs wish for a softer massage - he was very happy with the result. Come over here to relax directly and get your perfect massage! 	Good massage service. I felt like new after the back, neck and shoulders session. Fair price, clean place. 	Massage was on point. Every touch made me feel good and relaxed. We had 90 mins massage.  Both me and my wife agreed this is easily one of the best we had. Price is very good for such quality.  They have a proper massage chair with a hole. Clean and cozy to relax. 	We had a wonderful experience at the sea sand massage. We came in as a group of 5 and they accommodated all of us with the utmost professionalism. The massage itself was great, the staff was friendly and professional. Would definitely come back. 	Was a really good massage. One of the best I had in Thailand. When you there ask for Patty 	Saw the 4.9 stars and said I gotta check this. One of the best massages I had on samui! You gotta check this place if you're around. 	One of the best Thai massages I‚Äôve ever had üôè I had a very strong but painless massage and truly felt I was receiving therapeutic treatment from an expert. The entire team were super friendly and flexibly accommodated us at short notice. Really hope we‚Äôre nearby soon to drop in again. ‚Ä¶ 	Amazing massage place with great atmosphere, friendly staff and a great massage. I recommend masseuses M and Nun

We did several different ones here - deep tissue foot massage, head/back/neck/shoulders, after sun aloe vera treatment and massage. They have 1hr, 1.5hr and 2hr. The massage is so good - strong but you can ask for less pressure. We came back several times too :) highly recommend 	Me and my wife came here a few times. Very lovely kind staff who took care of us. I saw Big 3 times because the first time he did a great job. One of the best massages I have ever had. Very professional. Big remembered me and what I needed and he took great care of me each time I came back. I feel much better after my few sessions. My wife also saw a couple of ladies who were both great. Thank you! 	Kitty and I, along with a group of friends, decided to treat ourselves to a foot massage at Urban Thai Massage after a delicious dinner.  We had noticed it earlier during our walk back to the hotel and decided to come back.  We both opted for the hot stone massage, which was perfect after a few days of rain in Hatyai and Koh Samui. Kitty loved the hot stones as they helped to release some of the muscle aches and moisture from our bodies.  The massage itself was fantastic, and the hot stones felt very comforting. The staff were professional and skilled, and we were lucky enough to be attended to by two older aunties who had lots of experience. The atmosphere of the massage place was modern and cozy, and the prices were reasonable.  While we enjoyed the experience overall, there were a couple of small things that could have been improved. It would have been nice if they offered hot ginger tea before or after the massage.  We found it a little lacking not to have a warm beverage to relax with. 	I normally don‚Äôt give review often but I really have to appreciate this massage. It was SO good! If you have a chance, ask for ‚ÄûJib‚Äú, she was the nicest, most polite and comfortable lady.Also her massage was perfect. She found all the right spots, I didn‚Äôt even know were sore and tense and massaged it perfectly. definitely a Thai massage, but also definitely  durable! So highly recommend 	The worst massage ever. What a shame especially in Thailand. I can get a way better massage from my elderly mum. The lady who served me was either lazy or had 0 power to do the massage. What a waste of money to receive just putting some balm for 50 minutes on my feet with a repetitive movement and no real massage. On top of that the AC was too much. I got super cold despite they covered me with 3 towels! I got out from there with a sore throat. The atmosphere was unpleasant. Basically this place is so big, there is no real relaxation. People talking, passing behind you etc. The massage took less time that I paid for. It ended around 10 mins earlier and I was given a small bottle of water, no tea to warm me up after spending 50 mins in this cold place. Don‚Äôt make a mistake going there, better choose a small and more intimate place. 	Very highly recommended. I had a 4 hand deep tiger balm massage. This was  not on the menu but there was no problem arranging this. I got handled by 2 guys which with were laughing with me because it was a real deep deep massage üòÅ My wife meanwhile enjoyed her oil therapy massage and was also very pleased. ‚Ä¶ 	Ask For Leena, Give good Tip she very hard worker, she fixed my back and my Sciatic Pain and Severe shoulder pain, I feel so Good now, Best Massage in the World, Trumps all Aussie Massage Therapists. Strong‚Ä¶ Also There are fabulous Couples massage Rooms and a nice shower if your hot and sweety before the Massage‚Ä¶ Good Air Con and Professional 	Joy was ‚Ä¶ a joy! Wonderful hot stones massage with oil and so much love! I feel revived and can‚Äôt wait to come back ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	Unforgettable experience! Strong professionalism and great service. They wash your feet before the session, give you disposable pants, and clean towels. The man named M was fantastic. I made the 60-minute massage at 9 pm, and the room was impeccably clean. 	This place offers amazing massages and exceptional service! The manager, Nuch‚ô•Ô∏è, speaks excellent English and welcomes you with a warm smile. She takes the time to recommend the perfect treatment for your needs, ensuring a high-quality experience. All the therapists are professional, and the environment is clean and well-maintained. On top of that, the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!üôè 	I've been travelling around the world and always had massage whenever i had the chance. I work as a swedish massage therapist myself. I went here with my 2 adult kids, and we had each a 2-hour session with oil and thai massage. I can easily say that I have never, ever experienced such a professional,  sincere magical massage. The experienced humble man at my age (guess 45-55) is what you are really looking for if you want to have the best massage ever. Unfortunately I never caught his name. Best massage ever. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you üôè‚ù§Ô∏è 	This place is amazing! So calming and the staff are kind and very gentle. We had a great time and if we could, we would definitely have stayed for more than two treatments in a row. Definitely recommend you to try at least one time here 	Perhaps the best massage I've ever had. I was massaged by an older masseuse and she single-mindedly found every area that was causing problems, shoulders are still easy, but she even worked on my wrist, which always hurts. The massages here are much more expensive than elsewhere, but I have also found that the cheaper ones go through their standard programme without really addressing problem areas. I will definitely come back and have my tension worked away on this holiday. 	So far, this is probably the best massage place in Koh Samui. I travel to Samui quite often, and I truly believe this is the best massage experience I‚Äôve had. The manager, P‚Äô Noot, was incredibly friendly and welcoming from the moment I stepped in. I had been dealing with piriformis syndrome for the past two months and had tried several massage treatments in Bangkok before coming here. After a two-hour oil massage with P‚Äô Luxe (The masseuse), my pain was significantly reduced, and I felt like a newborn again. On top of that, the spa is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back on my next trip and thanks for the wonderful experience. 	Perfect place for a massage! We had 30 minutes foot massage und 90 minutes aroma oil full body massage and it was just wonderful. Private room, professionell and super massage staff, also asking during procedure if you are okay. Big thank you to Mam and Rue! Would definitively recommend. 	This is the 6th massage place I visited in Thailand. All the places were well checked and with predominantly excellent reviews. This place, as well. The price was a bit higher than other places we have visited during our vacation but decided to give it a go. Once you enter the building, this massage parlor seems to have very very large capacity - many workers and a number of chairs and rooms. I got the oil full body with tiger balm for 60 mins and my wife got the foot massage. My experience was pretty average, I would say even a bit below average. The lady who massaged me was gentle‚Ä¶ even too gentle. At the end I was relaxed but expected much more considering the  good rating the place had. At the same time, my wife‚Äôs experience was extremely disappointing. She said that her massage was repetitive, petting-like without pressure being applied and due to the air conditioning, she got sore throat. Unfortunately, we left Urban Thai Massage - Chabad House disappointed and will not be coming again. 	Very professional, clean and calming place. We had 2 massages here in our weeks stay to Koh Samui. The foot massage is lovely and I can also recommend the hands and head. My partner had the neck, back and shoulders massage twice and he highly recommends. All the staff are extremely polite and definitely have strong hands. 	We had an excellent experience overall. The place is very nicely maintained with good facilities. The staff was very polite and understanding. The traditional Thai massage itself was out of the world and very refreshing experience. Highly recommended 	Excellent massage, this place has a wide variety of techniques to offer, best massage spot to visit  on Chaweng! 	reviews don't lie, fair price very professional massage. I asked for a strong back and shoulders massage. the lady was super professional it seems she really knows what she's doing. I just came out and felt relieved.

The foot massage was incredibly relaxing, done in a comfortable armchair with a direct view of the beach. The full-body massage took place in a serene room with a large window overlooking the sea, adding to the tranquil atmosphere.  The room even had a shower, which was a thoughtful touch, and the massage beds were equipped with face holes for added comfort. The therapists were highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure in all the right spots‚Äîperfectly balancing effectiveness with relaxation.  A truly outstanding experience, both soothing and rejuvenating. Highly recommended. 	Premium feeling with ambient surroundings. Staffs are all with smart uniform. Pricing quite reasonable 1.5hour foot massage cost 600b 	Well i am person who really like being massaged but this is NOT my place for sure. Taking one of most expensive massages by 4 hands oil massage for 1200bat means you expect to be well maintend by someone who knows what to do... Belive me dont do that mistake. We spoke with the frond door woman for two women and I received one man and one woman so far so good i am for the massage maybe those are good ones. Terrible story man i thought i am on muai thai with only elbows then in a hurry not to miss the ferry... Wait the minite you have whole hour... No no i will stop. It is up to you, just to let you know. 	Visiting a Thai massage salon on the island of Samui is like stepping into paradise! Picture this: palm trees swaying gently outside, the soothing sound of waves in the distance, and inside the salon, a serene atmosphere that feels like pure bliss. Everything here exudes the magic of Thailand, from the warm smiles of the staff to every skilled movement of the therapist.  The massage itself? Absolutely transformative. It felt like the therapist wasn‚Äôt just working on my muscles but truly understanding what my body needed. Every stretch, press, and touch brought renewed energy and relief. By the end, I felt like a completely recharged version of myself‚Äîrelaxed, refreshed, and utterly at peace.  Samui has many treasures, but this salon is a true gem. If you‚Äôre seeking ultimate relaxation on this dreamlike island, don‚Äôt miss out. It‚Äôs an experience that reminds you why Samui is not just a destination but a place to reconnect with your mind and body. 	I wanted a Thai Massage with Tiger Balm and paid for it , but the guy didnt even usw it and couldnt even massage me in a proper way. I had a lot of massages but this one was the worst. We were 10 people and nearly all of us were disappointed. 	I‚Äôm so sad I could only go here once before heading back home. The relax package was unreal, the lovely lady who looked after me was amazing. There were a couple of spots where I was very very tight and she checked to see if I was alright once she found them. She worked more of the particularly tight parts which was amazing, parts I didn‚Äôt think were tight she found and helped relieve them. If only I was staying here for longer I would be there everyday if I could. The price for the service was unbelievable. If you‚Äôre on the fence about whether or not to treat yourself to a massage, don‚Äôt think, do and go here! 	Worst massage ever! We booked the 2-hour Urban Dream treatment for 1,500 Baht each, expecting a high-level experience. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. Our therapists were very bad, painful and not nice at all. That didn‚Äôt agree even to turn off the air conditioning even though I was freezing. They were acting like they were doing me a favor for giving us the massage, and seemed unprofessional. We left feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied. 	Very nice and clean place. Everyone was professional.My Masso wasn‚Äôt as great as I would like it but she was very nice. If you are picky like me, make sure to mention before you get your massage done. I‚Äôm about to get another massage again. ü§™ ‚Ä¶ 	Don't waste your time and money. The salon looks good, but it all ends there. My husband gave himself a 4-hand massage, which was terrible. The man who gave him the massage was rude and uncoordinated. No coordination between the four hands. During the massage, he said that he was very rude and careless, but there was no reaction. On leaving the studio, we also shared that the experience was terrible, but there was no reaction. I do not recommend. I did a relaxing massage, which was good. Our whole experience was bad. 	Omg best deep tissue massage ever. Wood was amazing! Had really bad back pain and tightness. After this massage I feel so much better and relaxed. We were looking for a good massage for an ages and finally find this one which was 10/10. Anyone with serious muscle aches I recommend you ask for wood or any of the male staff as they have more strength which was great! 	The best massage in the town, I had massage everyday at different places till I found Urban thai and I can clearly see they are so much better than others- the ambience, massage and professionalism is 10/10 	clean enviroment n friemdly staff not very strong oil quality is good	My partner and I did a massage together. It was my first Thai full body massage. I now have a much fonder regard for coconut oil!  Thank you so very much much for a wonderful experience. The ambiance and care was amazing for a first timer. 	I had one of the best massages ever! The masseuses were incredibly skilled and left me feeling completely relaxed. We opted for the Urban Relax package, and it was a fantastic choice. The couples‚Äô massage room was beautifully appointed and felt so inviting throughout the entire experience. They did ask if I was comfortable with a male masseuse at the beginning, which was incredibly thoughtful. I ended up saying yes, and the overall experience was amazing.	i have never had a massage before but this was actually incredible. i got a back, neck, and shoulder massage which also included my head üòª my masseuse paid specific attention to my knots and really provided me a lot of relief. thank you so much!! ‚Ä¶ 	This is the best neck, shoulder, back and head massage I‚Äôve ever had! The name of masseuse was Bella! She was so good! I really recommend this place. And it only kost 430Baht for 60minü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	Super relaxing experience, Tao was great with the foot and leg massage, with the perfect pressure. I was extremely relaxed and was made to feel super comfortable, also got a shoulder and neck massage at the end big thank you! Would definitely recommend ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® 	This is the best neck, shoulder, back and head massage I‚Äôve had. Toa was my masseuse. He was very good! It‚Äôs a nice place and it only costs 429 baht for 60 minutes massage. 	if you have to have a massage in ko samui chaweng, this is the salon you have to go to! and for my part the best masseur is this one, I don't know his name but he is tattooed on his face above the eye. I had 3 massages the last week of March 2025 and the first 2 were with him, and I who am not a fan of massages in general I was very calm with him. I recommend him to you! the 3rd time he was not available I had another man but ... less pleasant because too strong and even if you can ask not too strong, it was not at all the same! too bad .. but long live the next vacation in samui to do other massages but with my masseur otherwise nothing üòÇüëç 	Warm welcome. Very clean and well-maintained facility with comfortable chairs and massage tables. Excellent staff. There‚Äôs only one male massage therapist, Sakorm. If you‚Äôre looking for excellent pressure and great technique, this is your guy! Strong and deep pressure if you want. I came in feeling pretty knotty and stiff, and left feeling wonderful. Came with a friend and we‚Äôve been back a few times.

Masseuse kept on coughing, had no strength. It‚Äôs my first time asking to stop a massage earlier than it was supposed to. 800 baht for 1.5hrs. Don‚Äôt accept card payment. Absolutely horrendous. 	I was very satisfied with both the skills and friendliness of the massage therapists. However, I deducted one star because the towel on the pillow or mat in the massage room felt like it had been used by someone else. If hygiene is improved, I would be willing to visit again. 	Went for their 1.5hr deep tissue massage with foot massage and it was AMAZING! ‚ÄúEt‚Äù was my masseuse and she did a really good job. It was the right amount of pressure and strokes to get rid of my muscle tension. I swear, it was one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had. When she did the stretching bit towards the end, we both laughed as my back ‚Äúcracked‚Äù. Such a good way to end my Koh Samui trip.  Only downside was the location. It‚Äôs right across several clubs blasting party music. 	I had a 1 hour foot massage, but it wasn't a massage, just light stroking with oil. When I complained, they wanted to offer a more expensive massage. Unfortunately we had to pay in advance, otherwise I would have canceled after 30 minutes. 	Had an hour of deep foot/leg massage (for 500) from them, it is certainly nicer than the normal 300 relax foot massage. Good service. Competitor charge around 450-550 for this, so avg pricing. 	Two of us went, got the back & shoulder massage and other person got the leg and foot massage, very good back massage, was very firm which I'm able to tolerate, found and worked on spots I knew I had issues with, so knew what they were doing, other person found there massage excellent, depending on massage they do about of thai massage also to finish off 	Had many massages in Thailand. This falls under one of the better ones. Had nice oil massage with my partner for a good price. More than just rubbing, also a good level of pressure. Nice staff. 	Great experience that is relaxing and not rushed.  Experienced masseuses.  Pedicure was a little painful but good foot scrub. 	My daughter and I both had massages here and they were wonderful!  She got a (relax) foot massage while I got a Thai massage.  I asked her to concentrate on certain areas I was aching at and she went to town!  I left knot free :)  Her name was Noi.  Will def try to be back before we leave. 	Tried the deep leg and foot massage with therapist Noi and I simply loved her. She was very understanding with what I was going through and gave me just what I needed in terms of the right kind of pressure and massage therapy. Totally recommend Noi, the staff was also very friendly and courteous. Totally worth the 550 thb for an hour of relaxation and feeling new!! 	I had an amazing coconut oil massage!! Really wanted to go back but didn‚Äôt have the time 	If you‚Äôre looking for a serious professional clean massage studio you‚Äôre at the right place here! They‚Äôre amazing especially the two a bit elderly ladies they are so heartwarming, kind and they definitely decreased my back pain. We‚Äôre definitely coming back here again thank you guys ! 	First time my husband and I had Thai full oil message. Excellent massage; professional; relaxing; private room. Will definitely be back! This location in Fisherman‚Äôs Village open 2 months now. Clean and beautiful! Many thanks to the staff! 	I went there because of the reviews, and came out: why it has 4,6 stars?  I had pain in my back i went there to reduce the pain, i told my problem, and they recommended thai massage, but the massage was soft, like a relaxing massage, not like a thai massage, and costed 600BTH.  I've been in a lot of massage spas in Thailand, but definetly this one was the worst.  I think you can get cheaper and better massage at other places, so probably wont come back.  However the staff and the shop was pretty nice and clean, but this thai massage didnt solve my problem. 	Nice place, quiet and clean. Great atmosphere. We did foot massage after a long walking day and it was great. 	A really bad massage, I didn't feel at all that I was given a massage and that I asked for a stronger massage so that I would feel something, they asked me for an extra 200 baht. Shame and disgrace 	Great massage! Very professional. I originally went here to get some aloe lotion rubbed over my sunburn. My masseuse applied cool aloe and massaged my burned area very well. The rest of my body was very well done as well. Very good professional service here. I would go back here again. 	The best massages in koh samui & the lady who did mine is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è 	It is the worst thai massage i have ever had before. The lady was just like putting her fingers on my skin and no strength at all. i have asked her to press harder for few times but still no improvement. For the stretching motion, she just raised my leg and hands up and that's it. I couldn't feel anything after doing the 60min massage. It's a waste of time and money. 350THB/60min was not the cheapest in the town, guess there will be better choice nearby with more well trained staff. 	Amazing experience, i had a group of 7 and they accommodated all of us, we all got a combination of different massages and they were all 5 stars! Thanks so much :)

I had massage with coconut oil and it was amazing, very refreshing and relaxing. I love her technique and detailing. Worth the price. Will definitely comeback again!  Thank you so much.	Came with my 17 years old daughter twice during my 1 week stay.  We did 60mins back, shoulder and head massage first time. It was good with the right pressure although some part can be quite deep press.  Second time I did 60mins foot massage and my daughter did 60mins coconut oil massage. For my foot massage, it wasn't as painful as some places which was great for me and it came with a 5mins back and head massage as well. For my daughter, the coconut massage was really good and she fell asleep! There is more oil as compared with back, shoulder massage and hence much more comfortable and relaxing.  Overall the experience was fantastic and highly recommend for the price which was worth it! 	This place is amazing. Great prices and very great massage- I have had many all over Thailand.  Foot scrub was also fantastic to get off all the gunk from beaching the last few weeks.  Highly recommend! The herbal tea at the end was very delicious. 	Lovely manager and staff. Went for the coconut cream massage for 90minutes. This was more relaxing and not deep/g Hard massage. My husband enjoyed his massage. I was a little bit cold throughout the experience due to the aircon. Make sure you mention that you're cold or need softer/harder pressure. We recommend this place. 	We recently visited the Thai massage studio and had mixed experiences. I tried the coconut oil massage and was absolutely thrilled! The massage was wonderfully relaxing, felt amazing, and I left feeling completely refreshed.  Unfortunately, my wife didn‚Äôt have such a good experience with the head massage. After the treatment, she had extremely red spots on her scalp and felt pain, which definitely shouldn‚Äôt happen.  The atmosphere and service were overall pleasant, but we would recommend discussing any sensitivities or specific needs in advance. 	My partner and I both had a 90-minute Thai hot compress massage and they were amazing. It was like a mix of oil massage, Thai massage and compression with the hot compresses which further relaxed our muscles. So relaxing and 100% worth the price. Highly recommend! 	AVOID AT ALL COSTS! We were regular customers here for over 5 months. Me and my sister went for a 90 minute oil massage for 450 baht each. At the end of the massage the owner tells us that the massage is 600 baht each, as her staff said we chose the deep tissue massage. The owner said she didn‚Äôt care about what happened, all she cared for, was her 1200 baht. Now you have lost regular customers. Save yourself getting scammed here and go to another massage shop. 	We visited Baan Massage several times in one week (including Thai Massage, Aloe Vera Massage, and Head, Neck, and Shoulder Massage). While the range of massages and prices may be similar to other places in the area, the exceptional service sets Baan apart. From the relaxing foot wash at the start, the calming atmosphere‚Äîclose to the main road but not directly next to it‚Äîthe tea served at the end, and, of course, the outstanding quality of the massages, everything made this a truly enjoyable experience. Highly recommended! 	Just the best Thai Massage on Koh Samui!  The boss and the staff are very friendly and will relieve you of your pain! The prices have remained local compared to other Thai massage parlors. I've been there four times in the last week and will go again as soon as I'm back on Koh Samui. Simply super! Thank you very much :) 	It was very cold, I asked to turn off the aircon (we were alone), they didn‚Äôt listen. I had Thai with Coconut Oil, it was VERY light. When I had my ‚Äúrelaxing oil massage‚Äù at Zen Nassage, it was much harder than ‚Äúmedium Thai massage‚Äù here. I was disappointed 	very beautiful property & shop they have here. warm greeting & foot wash outside. great menu of treatments available & good prices. large proper massage tables & knowledgeable staff. climate-controlled & soft ambient music. recommended 	I visited this massage studio on Koh Samui because of its 4.7 Google rating, but I would personally rate it lower. The massage was generally good, but not exceptional. The background noise from the busy street was noticeable, and the masseuse occasionally chatted with her colleague, which disrupted the relaxation. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not outstanding. Next time, I‚Äôd try a different massage studio nearby. 	Excellent foot massage. Very relaxing. 	Great place for a good massage. Average prices, I had a girl who did a 1h Thai + 30min shoulders massage = 500bath. Feels amazing. The place is located aside from the road so it‚Äôs quite peaceful. Offered tea & water after. 	We would give them 10 stars if we could! The absolute best massage we had while in Thailand. Clean facility, very friendly people and amazing tea to end the experience. We had a traditional Thai massage and deep tissue. Both were incredible we would definitely go back again. 	Me and my wife went here. She got the aloe Vera massage, as we are two people from Scotland visiting Thailand and she ended up with sun burn and thought this would help, she was not disappointed!  I went for the Thai massage, as a fairly active guy who likes the the gym I thought it would loosen me up.  We walked in without booking and were seen to straight away.  We were kept together during our massage.  The staff were friendly and light hearted.  My massage was a really good deep one.  I‚Äôve been to loads of massage places over the years, this one really is genuinely good.  The price was 400baht for mine, which is incredibly reasonable. 	Great massage. We went twice. 	They have a great menu of massages and treatments. My partner and I visited twice during our vacation, and between us had the foot spa, deep Thai massage, Thai oil massage, and aloe massage. Very professional service, good value, and AC in the massage rooms. Highly recommended, would definitely return if in Samui. 	They have a great menu of massages and treatments.
