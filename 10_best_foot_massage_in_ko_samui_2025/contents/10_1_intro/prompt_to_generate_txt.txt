I had massage with coconut oil and it was amazing, very refreshing and relaxing. I love her technique and detailing. Worth the price. Will definitely comeback again!  Thank you so much.	Came with my 17 years old daughter twice during my 1 week stay.  We did 60mins back, shoulder and head massage first time. It was good with the right pressure although some part can be quite deep press.  Second time I did 60mins foot massage and my daughter did 60mins coconut oil massage. For my foot massage, it wasn't as painful as some places which was great for me and it came with a 5mins back and head massage as well. For my daughter, the coconut massage was really good and she fell asleep! There is more oil as compared with back, shoulder massage and hence much more comfortable and relaxing.  Overall the experience was fantastic and highly recommend for the price which was worth it! 	This place is amazing. Great prices and very great massage- I have had many all over Thailand.  Foot scrub was also fantastic to get off all the gunk from beaching the last few weeks.  Highly recommend! The herbal tea at the end was very delicious. 	Lovely manager and staff. Went for the coconut cream massage for 90minutes. This was more relaxing and not deep/g Hard massage. My husband enjoyed his massage. I was a little bit cold throughout the experience due to the aircon. Make sure you mention that you're cold or need softer/harder pressure. We recommend this place. 	We recently visited the Thai massage studio and had mixed experiences. I tried the coconut oil massage and was absolutely thrilled! The massage was wonderfully relaxing, felt amazing, and I left feeling completely refreshed.  Unfortunately, my wife didn’t have such a good experience with the head massage. After the treatment, she had extremely red spots on her scalp and felt pain, which definitely shouldn’t happen.  The atmosphere and service were overall pleasant, but we would recommend discussing any sensitivities or specific needs in advance. 	My partner and I both had a 90-minute Thai hot compress massage and they were amazing. It was like a mix of oil massage, Thai massage and compression with the hot compresses which further relaxed our muscles. So relaxing and 100% worth the price. Highly recommend! 	AVOID AT ALL COSTS! We were regular customers here for over 5 months. Me and my sister went for a 90 minute oil massage for 450 baht each. At the end of the massage the owner tells us that the massage is 600 baht each, as her staff said we chose the deep tissue massage. The owner said she didn’t care about what happened, all she cared for, was her 1200 baht. Now you have lost regular customers. Save yourself getting scammed here and go to another massage shop. 	We visited Baan Massage several times in one week (including Thai Massage, Aloe Vera Massage, and Head, Neck, and Shoulder Massage). While the range of massages and prices may be similar to other places in the area, the exceptional service sets Baan apart. From the relaxing foot wash at the start, the calming atmosphere—close to the main road but not directly next to it—the tea served at the end, and, of course, the outstanding quality of the massages, everything made this a truly enjoyable experience. Highly recommended! 	Just the best Thai Massage on Koh Samui!  The boss and the staff are very friendly and will relieve you of your pain! The prices have remained local compared to other Thai massage parlors. I've been there four times in the last week and will go again as soon as I'm back on Koh Samui. Simply super! Thank you very much :) 	It was very cold, I asked to turn off the aircon (we were alone), they didn’t listen. I had Thai with Coconut Oil, it was VERY light. When I had my “relaxing oil massage” at Zen Nassage, it was much harder than “medium Thai massage” here. I was disappointed 	very beautiful property & shop they have here. warm greeting & foot wash outside. great menu of treatments available & good prices. large proper massage tables & knowledgeable staff. climate-controlled & soft ambient music. recommended 	I visited this massage studio on Koh Samui because of its 4.7 Google rating, but I would personally rate it lower. The massage was generally good, but not exceptional. The background noise from the busy street was noticeable, and the masseuse occasionally chatted with her colleague, which disrupted the relaxation. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not outstanding. Next time, I’d try a different massage studio nearby. 	Excellent foot massage. Very relaxing. 	Great place for a good massage. Average prices, I had a girl who did a 1h Thai + 30min shoulders massage = 500bath. Feels amazing. The place is located aside from the road so it’s quite peaceful. Offered tea & water after. 	We would give them 10 stars if we could! The absolute best massage we had while in Thailand. Clean facility, very friendly people and amazing tea to end the experience. We had a traditional Thai massage and deep tissue. Both were incredible we would definitely go back again. 	Me and my wife went here. She got the aloe Vera massage, as we are two people from Scotland visiting Thailand and she ended up with sun burn and thought this would help, she was not disappointed!  I went for the Thai massage, as a fairly active guy who likes the the gym I thought it would loosen me up.  We walked in without booking and were seen to straight away.  We were kept together during our massage.  The staff were friendly and light hearted.  My massage was a really good deep one.  I’ve been to loads of massage places over the years, this one really is genuinely good.  The price was 400baht for mine, which is incredibly reasonable. 	Great massage. We went twice. 	They have a great menu of massages and treatments. My partner and I visited twice during our vacation, and between us had the foot spa, deep Thai massage, Thai oil massage, and aloe massage. Very professional service, good value, and AC in the massage rooms. Highly recommended, would definitely return if in Samui. 	They have a great menu of massages and treatments.

So clean, and the ladies are so helpful. Best massages ever. I go there almost twice a week 😉 …
