Went there for a foot massage and it was so good I had to go back for a body massage. The Deep Thai massage was amazing- very strong but left me feeling much looser and relaxed. Ladies there are lovely, with strong hands and on point technique.  Far better than some of the big shiny places nearby, I highly recommend if you want a proper massage. Would be going back again if I had the time! 	Wonderful massage! Husband and I have tried out multiple spas over our time here and we keep coming back to Sea-Sand. It’s relaxing and quiet like a spa should be. The workers are quiet and respectful and aren’t talking with each other the whole time. Not to mention the massages are the best. Strong hands and they actually seem to know what they are doing! Would highly recommend! 	One of the best massages I had. Had a great therapeutic effect and unbelievable relaxation. I had many massages in Asia, but it's far not always you get this deep feeling of really qualitative massage. Besides the place is nice and clean, and the room temperature is perfectly relaxing without air conditioning blowing on you like in the most places 	This is one of the best massages I’ve ever had in Thailand.  Ve did a deep oil massage and she did it with amazing effort and very attentively.  I don’t usually write reviews but for this place, I had to give a 10/10!  Lovely staff too. Thankyou! 🙏 	We read the reviews and decided to go for a massage with my wife. We were very pleased and came back 2 more times. I recommend a deep Thai massage lasting 90 minutes. 	The best massage of my life!!  I had a bad shoulder, so wanted to get a massage in the hopes it would help. After looking up the reviews on Google, I found this place. And I’m super happy I did.  From the first few moments i knew it was going to be good, when she found the first knot and set to work. The following 55 minutes was spent getting rid of all the other knots which instantly felt amazing!  The woman that did it was strong enough to push and squeeze all the pain away.  Every time I thought oh i wish she would apply pressure here or there within seconds she was doing it without me mentioning what i was thinking!  I have had problems with my shoulder for quite a while and within one massage it started to feel better!  I went back everyday i was in koh samui and already miss it!  Thank you so much! 	I had the best massage experience in my life. I visited all asian countries and honestly this was the best one I had. Patty soooo cute and her skills amazing. I took 1 hour massage, was my best 1 hour in my life :) Definitely will go again. Thank you Patty, you are nice :) 	In two months on Samui I have been here 6 times, and many times in other massage parlors. Sea sand is one of the best massage places on the island. I have tried here different massages, different masseuses, they are always attentive and diligent in doing the massage. Big thanks 🫶 	There is no need to look for another place for Thai massage. Patty is a great masseur, she relieved a different pain with each touch. I will definitely go again. I highly recommend it :) 	Good massage. Clean. My husband and I went twice and all 4 masseuses were great, good effort put into the massage with care. He liked Patty, he said at the end of the massage she gave a great head/scalp massage.  Definitely try this spot! 	Possibly the best out of the few massage spots i been to in Koh Samui. Very kind staff and lovely service. Me and my 2 friends came for foot massage then we came back again for full body coconut oil massage. i fully recommend it. Shout out to peng, patti and tik 🫶🏾 … 	Sea-Sand is the best massage shop I've ever been to. The place very clean, staff and owner are very skilled and friendly. I get relaxed every time I come here. And will come many times for sure 	We had a 1h foot massage here at our last day on Samui. And that‘s the only thing we regret: that it was our last day! The location is perfect, the interior very lovely and cozy and the staff is absolutely kind and it is very easy to communicate in English. They respected and took care of my husband‘s wish for a softer massage - he was very happy with the result. Come over here to relax directly and get your perfect massage! 	Good massage service. I felt like new after the back, neck and shoulders session. Fair price, clean place. 	Massage was on point. Every touch made me feel good and relaxed. We had 90 mins massage.  Both me and my wife agreed this is easily one of the best we had. Price is very good for such quality.  They have a proper massage chair with a hole. Clean and cozy to relax. 	We had a wonderful experience at the sea sand massage. We came in as a group of 5 and they accommodated all of us with the utmost professionalism. The massage itself was great, the staff was friendly and professional. Would definitely come back. 	Was a really good massage. One of the best I had in Thailand. When you there ask for Patty 	Saw the 4.9 stars and said I gotta check this. One of the best massages I had on samui! You gotta check this place if you're around. 	One of the best Thai massages I’ve ever had 🙏 I had a very strong but painless massage and truly felt I was receiving therapeutic treatment from an expert. The entire team were super friendly and flexibly accommodated us at short notice. Really hope we’re nearby soon to drop in again. … 	Amazing massage place with great atmosphere, friendly staff and a great massage. I recommend masseuses M and Nun
