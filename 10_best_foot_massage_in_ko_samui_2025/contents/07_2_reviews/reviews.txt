Saw <strong><u>Big</u></strong> 3 times, one of the best massages ever! <strong><u>Very professional</u></strong>, remembered what I needed.
Ask for <strong><u>Jib</u></strong>! Nicest lady, <strong><u>massage was perfect</u></strong>, found all the right spots. Highly recommend!
<strong><u>Leena fixed my back and sciatic pain</u></strong>! Best massage in the world, strong worker. Felt so good!
<strong><u>Joy was... a joy</u></strong>! Wonderful hot stones massage with oil and so much love. Feel revived!
Manager <strong><u>Nuch</u></strong> welcomes you warmly! Recommends perfect treatments. <strong><u>Professional therapists, clean environment, reasonable prices</u></strong>. Highly recommended!
Perfect massage! <strong><u>Private room, professional staff (Mam and Rue were great!)</u></strong>, asked if okay during procedure. Recommend!
Perhaps the best massage I've ever had! <strong><u>Older masseuse found every problem area</u></strong>. Worth the price!
Reviews don't lie! <strong><u>Fair price, very professional massage</u></strong>. Asked for strong, lady knew what she was doing.
Worst massage ever! Lady had zero power, just repetitive balm rubbing. AC too cold, got sore throat.
Foot massage was repetitive petting, no pressure. Left disappointed, won't be coming back again unfortunately.
