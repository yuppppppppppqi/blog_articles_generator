<strong><u>Rin was amazing</u></strong>, gave me the best deep tissue massage ever! So skilled and caring.
Had the best massage with <strong><u>Noi</u></strong>! Catered perfectly for pregnancy, <strong><u>better than 5-star hotels</u></strong>! Highly recommend!
Absolutely incredible Thai + aroma massage! <strong><u>Masters are really skilled</u></strong> with amazing pressure and techniques. Very relaxed!
<strong><u>Nui was absolutely amazing</u></strong>! Got all the pressure points perfectly while still being relaxing. Highly recommend!
My neck pain is gone thanks to <strong><u>Rin</u></strong>! She's fabulous, kind, and did a <strong><u>very good job</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Khun SA truly understands my needs</u></strong> and works on problem areas. Caring and professional. Recommended!
Best massage in Thailand! <strong><u>Patch and Toy were so nice and professional</u></strong>. Felt very relaxed afterwards.
Went often as a couple, always great! Therapists are <strong><u>attentive, make an effort, and really good</u></strong>. Prices fair.
Head massage was low effort, low quality. Just repeated scratching, felt weird and uncomfortable.
My husband's therapist touched private parts twice despite being told not to. Disgusting experience for him.
