Amazing experience! <strong><u>Relaxing foot massage with beach view</u></strong>, serene full-body room overlooking sea. Highly skilled therapists!
OMG best deep tissue massage ever! <strong><u>Wood was amazing</u></strong>, fixed my back pain. 10/10 recommend asking him!
Best massage in town! Found Urban Thai, clearly better than others. <strong><u>Ambience, massage, professionalism 10/10</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Bella gave the best neck, shoulder, back, head massage</u></strong> I've ever had! So good! Highly recommend.
Super relaxing! <strong><u>Tao was great</u></strong> with foot/leg massage, perfect pressure. Felt super comfortable. Definitely recommend!
<strong><u>Toa was very good</u></strong>! Best neck, shoulder, back, head massage. Nice place, great price for 60 mins.
Best masseur is the one tattooed above eye! <strong><u>Had 2 massages with him, very calm</u></strong>. Recommend him!
<strong><u>Excellent staff, Sakorm gives great pressure</u></strong> and technique! Left feeling wonderful after being knotty and stiff.
Worst massage ever. Therapists were bad, painful, unprofessional. Didn't turn off freezing AC. Very uncomfortable.
Four-hand massage was terrible. Uncoordinated, rude, careless man. No reaction when we complained. Bad experience overall.
