Located conveniently in Fisherman's Village, Coconut Paradise Spa offers a <strong><u>clean and professional environment</u></strong> for a relaxing treat. Visitors often highlight the <strong><u>skilled and friendly therapists, like Et and Noi</u></strong>, who are particularly effective at delivering deep tissue and foot massages that really hit the spot and relieve tension. While it provides a solid massage experience at average mid-range prices, some guests note a potential downside: noise from nearby clubs can sometimes filter in, slightly impacting the otherwise tranquil atmosphere.
