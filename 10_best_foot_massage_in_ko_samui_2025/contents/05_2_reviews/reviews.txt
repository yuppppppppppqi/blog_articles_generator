Wow! <strong><u>Exceptional head, back, neck, shoulders massage</u></strong>. Felt like Thai, deep tissue, chiropractic all combined!
Best sports massage ever! Was so sore, they fixed me right up. <strong><u>Lovely staff</u></strong>, got tea too!
Favourite massage in Koh Samui! Went back daily for 6 days. <strong><u>Clean, friendly, experienced ladies</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Masseuse Pen is the best</u></strong>! Relaxed my swollen calf, back, shoulder perfectly. Highly recommended for females!
Pain disappeared after the massage! <strong><u>Masseuse did exactly what I asked</u></strong>. Highly recommend for pain relief!
Prices might be 50 baht higher for some services, but quality makes it worth it.
