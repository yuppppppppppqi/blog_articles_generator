I had the most amazing eyelash extensions done at Eve’s Boudoir, and I couldn’t be happier! Jenny was amazing. The attention to detail was impeccable—lightweight, natural-looking. The process was relaxing, and the staff was incredibly professional and gentle. My lashes look full, fluffy, and effortlessly glamorous!  If you’re looking for high-quality lash extensions in Samui, this is the place to go. Highly recommended! 💕✨  This was my second visit to Eve’s Boudoir, and once again, it did not disappoint! Nim is truly amazing—her massage technique worked wonders on my stressed shoulders, leaving me feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I highly recommend booking a session with Nim. Can’t wait to return! 💆‍♀️✨ 	We came as a family and the service at Eve's Boudoir was impeccable. My wife and daughter had a manicure and foot massages whilst I was having an aromatic oil massage. Special kudos to Nina, Mod and Itim for the great massages and to Beauty for her 1st class manicure. We will be coming back during our stay in Koh Samui. 	I had an absolutely incredible massage experience that exceeded all expectations. From the moment I arrived, everything was tailored perfectly to my preferences — the pressure, the technique, and the overall pace of the treatment. The atmosphere was serene and calming, with a quiet, almost meditative ambiance that helped me completely disconnect from daily stress. . Special thanks to I-Tim, my therapist, who was not only highly skilled but also warm, attentive, and respectful throughout. Her intuitive touch and professionalism made all the difference.  Highly recommended for anyone in need of true relaxation and personalized care. 	Lee gave the best massage I’ve had in Thailand. I chose the aroma oil massage and it was worth it. She worked on my tension and knots and it was also very relaxing 	What a great salon! I had the best Mani Pedi done by the lovely Beauty, she did such a professional job and I definitely recommend! 6 stars! 	Excellent massage by Nee Ging. We got a hot stone massage and it was so relaxing! An amazing place. 	I had a great experience with the Thai massage! The massage was very professional and effective. Therapist Nee did an excellent job – her technique was outstanding, and she targeted all the right pressure points. I felt wonderfully relaxed and refreshed afterward. Highly recommended! 	Wonderful massage. My husband had lee and Nee for a 4 hands massage and I had Pailin for a leg and foot massage. They were all great! We had the last one from 10pm as they close at 11pm. Very clean and the manicure and pedicures look great too. White leather chairs and beds upstairs for massages. Great pressure too. 	Me and my friends had a great time at this place! We got a foot massage and some shoulders massage! Lee, Itim and Nina were amazing! Will definitely be back, they also serve you some ginger tea after the treatment!  Went back to get my nails done by Beauty! She’s amazing! 	Would highly recommend Eves boudoir. I was served by Beauty. Lovely gel manicure. Very professional and clean with AC. Nice to have a towel and water before hand and a tea afterwards. Will be returning for massage. 	Had a great experience with Beauty! She was kind, professional, and paid attention to every detail. The salon was very clean, and there were so many beautiful colors to choose from. My nails look amazing — highly recommend! 	My daughter and I had an amazing experience at Eve’s Boudoir today. The service was exceptional. My daughter got her perfect manicure and pedicure by KT who was so great, thorough and kind. I had an absolute wonderful massage by Nim who really understood my problem areas and I felt very comfortable with her and I could really feel her kindness. We will definitely come back. 	The whole experience has just been amazing here. From the way I was welcomed with a foot wash before entering to the way I left with such a full heart. The staff is absolutely amazing here. I had my lashes done with beauty and I am absolutely so happy with it! Thank you to the team here for such a wonderful experience 🤍🙏🏽 … 	One word: exceptional! My friend and I chose different packages, and we were absolutely delighted with this unique experience. We opted for two "Thai Steam Herbs," with a scrub for my wife and a Thai massage for me.  By the next day, my slight cold had completely disappeared, proof of the quality of the treatments. The Thai massage was simply sublime—so delicate and relaxing that I completely unwound… and even fell asleep!  As for my wife, she loved her mango scrub. Her skin was incredibly soft afterward. A special touch that stood out: they use banana leaves to wrap the body, a natural and elegant alternative to the cellophane typically used in Europe.  Another noteworthy detail: a secure locker is provided to store your jewelry and personal belongings, which inspires great trust.  In short, an unforgettable moment that I highly recommend. This salon deserves more than five stars! 	Very good massage recommend massager lee and Pailin,Nice and clean place good service very good price 🥰👍🏻 & friendly staff 👍🏻 … 	Excellent experience! I was really afraid to have my eyelashes extensions done here, but Beauty did a wonderful and quick job! Also my mom got here nails done here day before and told that the service and quality is wonderful here! Agree 100% 🥰 PS! Make sure to book an appointment if you want eyelashes, you may not get a time right away and just walk in 😜 	Beauty was so great incredible pedicure service was welcoming and kind and good price. Highly recommend. I also went back again for a sauna, scrub and oil massage by Nee. The most relaxing experience. Very professional, gentle and attentive. Very very good. Would highly recommend 	Wonderful experience. You get a nice little foot scrub on the way in, you also get to choose which scented oil you want used in your massage,  you are then given cold water and a fresh cold towel. Me and my partner did the 90 minute full body and I would highly recommend it. We came out to a lovely cup of ginger tea at the end. Definitely worth a visit. 	I was very pleased with my manicure and pedicure. I highly recommend the salon. Special thanks to Lee Beauty and Apple. 	Visited here for nails and massage. Impressed by the detail of the manicure by beauty, had a great massage with Lee and Nim for my partner and I. Next time we’re here we’ll come back. The prices are very good and the place extremely clean. Lovely service with some complimentary water, cold towel and tea post treatment. Thank you!
