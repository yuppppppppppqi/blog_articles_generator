<strong><u>Nim is truly amazing</u></strong>! Her massage worked wonders on my stressed shoulders. So relaxed now!
<strong><u>Lee gave the best aroma oil massage</u></strong> I've had in Thailand! Worked on all my tension.
Had the best mani-pedi from the <strong><u>lovely Beauty</u></strong>! Such a professional job, highly recommend!
<strong><u>Exceptional service</u></strong>! My daughter loved her manicure by KT, and Nim's massage was wonderful and kind.
Flawless eyelash extensions by <strong><u>Jenny! Lightweight, natural</u></strong>, and the process was relaxing and professional. Highly recommended!
Whole experience was amazing, from the foot wash welcome to leaving with a <strong><u>full heart</u></strong>.
Visited for nails and massage. <strong><u>Great manicure by Beauty, fantastic massage with Lee and Nim</u></strong>. Very clean!
<strong><u>Incredible pedicure service by Beauty</u></strong>! Welcoming, kind, and good price. Nee's oil massage was so relaxing too!
Had to book ahead for eyelashes, couldn't just walk in. Plan accordingly if you want them!
So many great color choices for nails, it was almost hard to pick just one! Good problem.
