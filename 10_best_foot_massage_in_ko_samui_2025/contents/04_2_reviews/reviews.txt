<strong><u>Beautiful place and lovely owner Ning</u></strong>! Really good service, comfortable massage, yummy ginger tea afterwards.
<strong><u>Ning's provides the BEST massages</u></strong> we've ever had! Insanely good Thai Oil massage. Absolute MUST visit.
<strong><u>Biew is such a talented masseuse</u></strong>! Left feeling incredibly relaxed. Lovely place, professional and friendly staff.
Excellent place! Came a few times, <strong><u>great service</u></strong> time after time. Design is nice, professional service.
<strong><u>Nadia is amazing</u></strong>! Knows just how strong each body part needs. Finds all the areas needing attention.
Proper real massage! Calming, deep massage into tense muscles by <strong><u>owner Ning</u></strong>. Delightful extras too!
The <strong><u>staff were pure brilliant</u></strong> - friendly an' welcomin'. Massages were amazin' too! Went five times!
<strong><u>Shania's thai massage with oil was excellent</u></strong>. Clean and refreshing place. Definitely try if nearby!
Worst foot massage ever. Therapist wasn't focused, never touched my feet, only calves. Needs retraining.
Sports massage was disappointing, therapist seemed inexperienced. Couldn't communicate well in English. Left uncomfortable.
