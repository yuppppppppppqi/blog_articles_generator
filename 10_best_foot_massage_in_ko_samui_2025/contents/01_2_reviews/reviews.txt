<strong><u>Truly professional, very clean setting</u></strong>. Nong & Tu were exceptional! Highly recommended!!
My masseuse <strong><u>Laura was amazing</u></strong>! Great atmosphere and fair prices, especially with the sea view.
Came back twice! Lovely facility, <strong><u>amazing views</u></strong>, and the couples oil massage was impressive.
<strong><u>Nee pinpointed every stiff muscle</u></strong>! Felt so pleasant, relaxed, and satisfied afterward. Highly recommend her!
Fantastic experience! Super clean, smelled good, and <strong><u>MAN gave an excellent, strong yet gentle foot massage</u></strong>.
One of the best foot massages ever! <strong><u>Clean place, friendly, super professional staff</u></strong>. Worth the extra cost.
So fresh after my full body oil massage! <strong><u>Mr. Kai was very welcoming</u></strong> and friendly. Best in Samui!
The <strong><u>couples body scrub and massage was calming</u></strong>, ladies were funny, walked out feeling brand new!
Massage felt more like a superficial rub; therapist couldn't provide the requested pressure. Disappointing.
Foot massage missed my toes and heel, the spots I like most. Still relaxing overall though.
