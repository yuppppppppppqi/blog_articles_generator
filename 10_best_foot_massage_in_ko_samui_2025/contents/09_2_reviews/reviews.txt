Deep tissue/foot massage with <strong><u>Et was AMAZING</u></strong>! Right pressure, got rid of tension. Best ever!
<strong><u>Noi went to town</u></strong> on my aching areas during Thai massage! Left knot free. Wonderful!
Loved the deep leg/foot massage with <strong><u>therapist Noi</u></strong>! Understanding, gave just what I needed. Totally recommend!
Amazing coconut oil massage! <strong><u>Really wanted to go back</u></strong> but didn't have time. Great experience!
Serious professional clean studio! <strong><u>Elderly ladies are heartwarming, kind</u></strong>, decreased my back pain. Coming back!
First Thai full oil message, <strong><u>excellent, professional, relaxing</u></strong>! Clean, beautiful new location. Many thanks!
Great massage! Very professional aloe rub for sunburn. <strong><u>Masseuse did rest of body very well</u></strong> too.
Accommodated our group of 7, <strong><u>all massages were 5 stars</u></strong>! Amazing experience, thanks so much!
Worst massage ever. Masseuse kept coughing, had no strength. Asked to stop early. Absolutely horrendous.
Thai massage was too soft, like relaxing massage. Didn't solve my back pain. Disappointed for the price.
