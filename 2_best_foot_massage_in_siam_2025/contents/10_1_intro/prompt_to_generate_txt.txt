Place is a little run down. Very bright, people walking pass while you massage. 2nd floor also not very clean environment. Massage so 	My girlfriend and I get a lot of massages and we can say that if you are staying I. Bangkok and want a professional massage with amazing friendly therapists then Na Siam Massage in Bangkok is number 1.  Located right next to Siam Paragon in Siam Square the shop is extremely clean and has a very relaxing feel from start to finish.  We want to personally thank Mr Chu (photo) and P Cee who were absolutely marvellous and over 20 years massage experience.  Wish we could take them back to Australia with us.  Thanks again and we look forward to visiting next time we are back in Bangkok. 	I had an amazing experience at Na.Siam Massage! The authentic Thai oil massage and foot massage was incredibly relaxing and exactly what I needed. The staff were not only friendly but also highly skilled and well-trained, ensuring a professional and soothing experience. The atmosphere was calm and inviting. I highly recommend!! 	Got massage at this place more than 2 yrs back and I came looking for it this time too as it was of very high quality. Had a hard time finding it but finally here I was!  It's just beside the Siam BTS and also has small interesting market in front of the place.  The quality is still the same and had a very good massage. They have a big room upstairs for full body massage. Also has reduced the cost probably due to pandemic. Unbeatable for the price.  Also went to mbk level 3 massage center the other day. Quite crampy and only a small room. Not ideal at all for all the usual Thai massage maneuvers! Will come back again. 	Pleasant and clean place to have massage after a long day in BKK. Prices are more reasonable than some of the nearby ones. Staffs are friendly too. Recommend 🙏🏻☺️ … 	You have to take a chance and it'll depend on who you'll get as your masseuse. Some are really good, some are just ok. However they did the whole 60 minutes and it was worth the money paid. 	Male therapists r horrible. I visited twice within one week with my fds, just because of the package is cheap.  However, I don’t understand why the therapists will ride on my body during massage (included front n back side). This is horrible and heavy.  Beside that, their skills are nice, this is the only reason I visited twice.	Oil massage for 60mins. The therapist skills is good, but don’t know why she was sitting on my legs when massaging the back, she is so fxxking heavy! Beside that, the environment is not really good and super noisy. 3 stars is go for her skills. 	Chance upon this place, did couple Aroma Oil Massage in a private room.  Easy to secure booking, although it was full at that point in time.  Masseurs were nice, with decent techniques.  Shop maybe a little old, but definitely return for massage.	This was one of the best massage Ii ever had after a long day of shopping near Siam area. They had some of the friendliest and the most professional masseurs, especially my preference is on prefer male masseurs who just knew those right pressure points. It is my go-to place whenever I come back to this second home of mine. By the way, do look for khun Chong if your prefer soothing male hands. 	Very good massage excellent skills really good experience excellent.😍😌 … 	Thank you DAO and M & Patty for arranging the massage for us since our 1st of the trip! Very thankful 🙏🏻 and they rlly can arrange properly for everyone :) … 	I did Thai massage. The lady sat on my back. They provided a pillow, so you had to either had to rest left or right side on the pillow. She put her entire body weight on my back when she moved side to side and after 1 hour my right neck was hurting. It was better not to massage at all then to be hurt after that. Terrible!!  Beware tourist! This place buys reviews! All the tourist gave bad reviews. Only “local Thai” gave 5 stars.	The worst massage, depend on the person who provide message, the one I had is basically touching my leg. 	Bad experience. -Basically just apply the oil without proper massage pressure. -The guy non stop talking to a female massagist sitting next to. -The worst is he keeps make fun of another elderly male massagist. At the end he ask for TIP… I don’t think the bad service deserve tip lazy staff and not professional	Reasonable prices though still a tad more expensive than places further out. Had a foot massage which was done well and painfully relaxing. The problem is the layout where the cashier and waiting area is lined up face to face with those in the massage chairs. So it became like a noisy fish market as this waiting talked loudly, disturbing any semblance of tranquility. If only people were more considerate like the Japanese who would whisper or avoid talking while others are trying to relax. 	Really bad when I compare the Thai massage i had on a Sunday night. Really really bad!!!! Edit to downgrade further from two to one star after finding out from my wife. ... Pls avoid!! 	Worst massage experience. Will not come back or recommend to others.	Perfect 👍🏽 will come back definitely. Don’t look at the reviews, the therapist for me and my girlfriend were great. Fixed my muscles and relaxed the body. Highly recommend 🙏🏼 … 	Although the masseuse was friendly, I felt not enough pressure in my foot massage. I had to tell her to massage my foot after she spent about 20 mins on my calf, which is really not needed. I should have read the reviews before i tried this place, but i was desperate for a massage for my very sore feet. Went in sore. Came out still sore, just with more oil on the feet. Such a pity
