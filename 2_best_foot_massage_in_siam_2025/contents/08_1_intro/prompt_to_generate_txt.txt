Highly recommended! Located in the basement of Fortune Town Mall. Try to avoid evening hours as it can get quite busy 	😳 Generally very good massage.  At least when not full of loud Chinese.  Prices better than most places. … 	I ordered a shoulder, neck, and head massage.　The masseuse massaged my upper back for 45 minutes.　I'm sure He can do a normal Thai massage, but He doesn't seem to know how to massage  shoulders, neck and head. He didn't massage my shoulders, neck and head at all, and I endured it for 45 minutes lying on my stomach, but then I told him about cancel the massage and told the grumpy old lady at the counter what I had.. I had to put up with the disgusting 45 minute massage on the same area, but I paid 100B... 100B for an uncomfortable massage...  Dont go here!  owner never trained their staff. 	We had the 60min foot massage for 180baht and it was much better than places with double the price on soi 24. Many male masseuses here who do a very good job, strong massage and focus on feet. We would always come back here. 	I go for massage regularly and I know within the first 5 mins that the masseuse knows nothing about massages. It was the worst massage I've ever exprienced ! literally just rubbing the oil all over in circles without method nor targetted steps.  I left before time up as it is sickening to be rubbed all over. Complained to the counter and they still charge me. Its nothing short of cheating if customer has to pay for an old lady who knows nothing about massage but just rubbing all over in circles continuously  4 of us had oil massage and basically everyone was highly dissatisfied and felt taken for a 'rub'. Like marinating in oil. 	I’m a frequent visitor to this massage shop, located on the ground floor of the mall. Prices are much lower than elsewhere in Bangkok, with a foot massage for just 180 Baht. Skilled masseurs and a welcoming atmosphere make it highly recommended. 	I have been here for couples of times, it’s good for money for foot massage and a rest, but last time I had shoulder and neck massage, I was not happy with the male masseur kept playing on his phone while massage until I told him not to do. 	Very disappointed. I ordered foot massage. I have never seen so unprofessional massage ever. 	Worst massage ever! First the therapist (don’t think she even deserve this title) has no idea what she were was doing or meant to be doing. She just sit there “touching” or moving her hand on me, but not actually “massaging”.  Secondly, she finished her therapy earlier than expected ( paid for 90mins but she finished at around 80 mins and lied to her supervisor that we have already finished)  Please don’t go here unless you are looking for nightmare	Went on sat 3 Feb for a body scrub massage together with my partner. Was attended by an old lady. Speaking in Thai language to her please focus more on my neck. But she ignored it. She massage skills was so bad that I don’t feel great at all. Others then the old lady . That’s a guy working there just open my door while we’re still having massage. How can he come in just like this while my partner and I were just wearing the paper undergarments provided by the shop. Not recommended. Totally unacceptable. 	The worst massage from a guy who kept coughing and didn't know what he was doing. Keep going down n on the other side of the mall hallway there is a massage place that is 20 bhat more expensive, but WAYYYYY BETTER	I go here regularly and think it's good value for money.  Mostly had good massages, but it all depends on the masseuse.  There are a number of massage shops on the ground floor of fortune town but this is the one I come back to if I'm in the area. 	At first the service is good，but when the staff massage my head，i told her can harder.but she didn’t respond and told to her workmate in Thai,i don’t understand Thai language,but i heard some word’s about harder,and that sounds not kindly.and when my arms put on the rong location,she judged me rudely by her hands. I don’t wanna come again,and if u wanna come can choose carefully… 	At first the service is good，but when the staff massage my head，i told her can harder.but she didn’t respond and told to her workmate in Thai,i don’t understand Thai language,but i heard some word’s about harder,and that sounds not kindly.and when my arms put on the rong location,she judged me rudely by her hands. I don’t wanna come again,and if u wanna come can choose carefully… 	Reasonable price. Only 160 Baht per hour for Thai massage, 200 per hour for thai massage with oil. 	I opted for 1.5-hour session.  Price is affordable.  Masseur mainly focus most of the time, massaging on the leg and thigh area but very less on the upper back and neck.  (not very balanced).  My Masseur has the strength but it really depends on which masseur you met that day (depends on your luck).  They have thai style shirt and shorts for you to wear.  For myself, I wore an underwear  with the shorts on.  My masseur speaks very simple english but not very fluent.  Overall experience is ok for the price. 	I got a foot massage for an hour, and I thought it was heaven. A man of normal height gave me a massage, and I was very satisfied. If I visit Bangkok next time, I am willing to come again. 	Super value!! 180 baht one hour message. Massage pretty good at this price! 	Valued for money massage , price are lower than any massage store in bangkok 	Had thai massage from male masseur for 90mins but he had body massage only 50mins he had facial and shoulder massage another 40mins with sleeping 😴 haha  masseur sleeping when he did massage and he touched my face but I knew that he just had smoking  can smell  so bad experience i think bangkok massage quality really so bad now  many places massage wasnt good
