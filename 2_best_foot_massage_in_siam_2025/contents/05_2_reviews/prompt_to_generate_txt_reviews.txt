The mango sticky rice at the end is so good too. 	My first choice for massage in Thailand. Visited at least once every time I’m in Bangkok. Professional masseur. 	Very convenient location in the shopping mall, with nice and helpful staff. The massage was really relaxing. Highly recommended! 	Exceptional service with the highest quality products! A refreshing warm pillow for your comfort. Conclude with hot towels and body lotion. Five-star luxury level! 	Amazing massage experience with this BTS platform view from Siam. Service is good as always. And there are signature mango sticky rice after your massage refreshment ✨ Lovely day with Let's Relax! Definitely come back again.	Good massage session with Khun bunyawadi at Lets Relax, its outlet @Siam Square One Nice reception welcome and complimentary mango dessert with herbal tea. 	Great place just below moxy hotel where we stayed. Staff were friendly and masseuse were good too. Place is aesthetically pleasing and not those dark massage parlours that make me feel a bit creeped out hahaha I also like that there are rooms and not just curtain dividers. Highly recommend!	Been coming here since 2022 & I always go to Let’s Relax every Thailand trip since then. Photos below are actually from all my trips and you can see I really enjoyed my time. I suggest to go with Thai massage for first timers & book in advance so that you can secure your slot (at least 24 hours). :)  Will come back on my next trip to Thailand!	I had the dream package, which is so far the best quality/price value. Adequately priced, and clean. The massage highly depends on masseuse. That said, most of them are wellqualified i think. 	It is always wonderful experience here! The masseurs are always up to our standard! We came here once a day! Highly recommended! 	**Terrible Experience at a "Reputable" Massage Shop - Stay Away!**  I recently visited this highly-rated massage shop, but my experience was shockingly awful. The masseuse lacked any proper technique or strength – it felt like I was being lightly patted rather than receiving a real massage. To make matters worse, her attitude was dismissive and unprofessional throughout the session.  **The worst part?** After the massage, she outright **demanded** that I give her a "5-star rating," instructed me to "leave with a smile," and warned me not to "cause trouble for her." This blatant attempt to manipulate reviews is not only unethical but also deeply offensive.  Do **not** waste your time or money here. This place prioritizes fake ratings over genuine service. Save yourself the disappointment – avoid at all costs!	Since discovering Let’s Relax, we always choose it over other massage places in Bangkok. Reservations are a must, and what continues to impress us and keeps us returning is the delightful mango sticky rice served after the therapy session! Mango sticky rice is a Bangkok essential!  The aromatherapy sessions are conducted by female masseurs who ensure you're fully relaxed with a shower before their skilled techniques soothe your soul for a blissful 60 minutes.  Currently, the Aroma Oil Massage is priced at ฿1,300.	It's my first time coming here and I had a wonderful experience. The staff were very accommodating,friendly and professional. I feel that my body was so relax. definitely a worth going if you are here in Thailand and I will come back soon. 	very good ambience . Receptionist are friendly and polite.  Good Massage 	My wife and I went for a 2 hour aromatherapy massage. I was attended by Ms Punnisa. This is one of the best therapeutic massages I have ever had - she kneaded all the major muscle groups with professionalism. She knew where to apply pressure.  The welcome tea and the mango sticky rice at the end of the treatment were nice touches!  Highly recommended, I’ll be back for sure! 	Nice facilities. When you arrive they give you wet towel for the face but the towel was dry and not cold. Spacious room with private shower. Heated massage beds. We did the warm oil massage in room for couple. Everything was clean and relaxing. Would appreciate it if the masseurs will not talk between them during the massage. 	Exceptional service and care at Let’s relax Spa! The staff were kind and welcoming, and my therapist was highly skilled. I felt completely relaxed and at ease with city view included. Highly recommend! 	I booked my massage on the wrong day by mistake and totally missed my appointment but they answered my email within the day and changed my booking for me without fuss. 🙇🏻‍♀️  The massage rooms are so clean and the entire experience feels really lovely, from the start till the end, where they serve you mango sticky rice hahahah. Def returning.	Located at level 6 Siam Square 1 which is just next to the BTS. Very nice decor and atmosphere. Prices is a bit steep. Very friendly front desk staff. Serves mango sticky rice for dessert after the massage. Massage was OK with the right pressure and attentiveness. 	I feel relaxed and rejuvenated after the massage. Definitely coming back!! Highly recommended!!
