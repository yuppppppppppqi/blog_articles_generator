Totally loosen up after a day of work, traffic and walking around the city. 	I was looking for a massage on Christmas Eve and came across Lek Massage Bangkok - Lek Foot Massage. I opted for a 1.5-hour aroma oil massage, and it was the best decision! My therapist, Frank, was exceptional. He truly knows how to apply the perfect amount of pressure, ensuring every part of my body felt relaxed and rejuvenated. Frank’s expertise in making me feel completely at ease is commendable—kudos to him for such outstanding service! The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the massage and the overall experience. I will definitely be returning to this wonderful place on my next visit to Bangkok. Highly recommended! 	Foot massage was average - I wasn't too satisfied with my massage to be honest. But was just glad I could find a place as all other massage places nearby were fully booked. 	Clean place, received a bottle of water after our session instead of tea and price is a tad on the expensive part. 	Unfortunately I did not enjoy much with the massage. I am male and they assigned make person for my massage without asking my preference.  The male used too much power which was painful to me. He also massage the chest which normally doesn’t happen, that too after opening my shirt. That was not nice. I did not really feel relax with the massage  Good thing about this place is they speak English, and it is modern and clean. Unfortunately I didn’t enjoy my massage	I went to Lek Massage to do foot massage on 2 days. I paid 350 baht for a 1h foot massage. I could pay by cash or card without being asked for extra charge. The strength was good and the masseurs did not talk among themselves. I appreciate this aspect as my pet peeve is when the masseurs talk among themselves and disrupt the serenity of the ambience. I observed that Lek renovated since I went there 2.5 years ago, Pre-Covid days. 	I recently had a wonderful experience at this place. While I can't recall the name of the male masseur, his skills were truly exceptional. From the moment he started massaging, he seemed to intuitively know the sore parts of my back muscles and skillfully focused on those areas without me having to ask. His ability to identify and address my specific needs was impressive. The massage itself was fantastic. The pressure was just right, and he expertly worked out the knots and tension in my muscles. I would highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a skilled and attentive message therapist. 	We have a good relationship with them. The first day of massage was them, and the second day was also theirs. They are very kind and their massage skills are also great. I will visit Lek Massage again when next time I go to Bangkok ☺️☺️ 	Recommend by my friend Tried the Foot massage last night and today tried the oil massage Very impressed with the skill of the masseuses I got, foot was Kate and full body was Nam.. especially Nam she really tried to loosen all the "blockages" yet not harsh when you show pain. 3 days of intensive walking and shopping.. this is really rewarding... Price wise also very reasonable.. hope the next time I come, she is still around.	Had a full body oil massage given by a wonderful lady named Phat. I appreciated every minute of the massage and I loved the tonicity and strength of it. Thank you Phat. 	Me and my husband live in Thailand and went there to try the 1h foot massage.  My massage lady gave very soothing strokes of massage although not focusing on the acupuncture points.  My husband however was entirely dissatisfied with the service. The lady did not have any strength at all and just moving her hands here and there like tickling. He asked for more professional service but to no avail and halted the service before the time was up.	Everyone wants safe massage zone. and quality insurance. Lek try to SHA. Good time for me. Foot 1hour + Head and shoulders 30m 500THB. Little bit expensive than Local shop but Safe and Clean. 	sorry,worst massage i had in Thailand Just seeing as a foreigner, assign me a lazy massager , tickle ? touching ? They dt know i speak Thai , I'm just here to survey which massage shop for my coming work trip . Sorry definitely not you Speak bad behind customer  Sorry no again.	My therapist was a new employee with little to no experience. I paid 1600 baht for an aroma massage and was essentially getting a back rub. When I reminded her that this was a full body massage, she ran out of the room! The manager came in to see what the problem was and I told her the same thing. She sent in a different therapist and she did a good job. Only two stars because they should have provided more training to new staff before letting them work on customers! 	I did aroma body for 2hr, nice experiemce and clean enviroment.  Lots of tourists but no need advance booking.  It seems they have many outlets all stone throw from each other.  This one is directly opposite side door of Novotel Siam Square Hotel.  Will sure be back again. 	Extremely noisy and rushed foot massage session. My foot wasn’t dried properly after the foot bath and made to walk to the massage chair in a pair of sticky slippers.   I had many noisy tourists walking in front of me as they arrive for session / left after their session . Will never set foot into this marketplace place again 	Massage is ver bad , Not recommend to try here at all, The massage wasn't to the point at all. And staff they didn't focus to the customer, seem like pay money for nothing 	The body massage I’ve experienced at this location isn’t good. The masseuse started off really light and after I asked if it’s possible to increase in strength, he straight up applied pressure without skill. Overall, the massage wasn’t up to standard and this fact is amplified by the price. I visited this chain because I had a good experience in another location. 	Fantastic massage n very good service! No wonder it’s my fav place for massage when in bangkok.	Avoid this joke of a place. What a scam. I paid 30 mins for Head Back massage and they only did 20 minutes. Lady spent 5 minutes adjusting the chair, 5 minutes left me waiting and ended early. Doing the calculations again, massage was only 15 minutes since she ended it so early. Waste of time. Any other chain is better. What a scam and they were so rude about it.
