I was not disappointed!  Taking advantage of their happy hour discount, I indulged in a full-body Thai massage for only 300 THB. As an avid runner, I especially appreciated the attention given to my calves, thighs, hamstrings, and forearms – areas that often bear the brunt of my training. The therapist skillfully worked on these specific muscle groups, easing tension and leaving me feeling rejuvenated.  Beyond the targeted muscle work, the overall experience was fantastic. The air-conditioned room provided a welcome respite from the Bangkok heat, allowing for complete relaxation. The therapist was professional and knowledgeable, ensuring a comfortable and therapeutic session.  If you're seeking a quality Thai massage in Bangkok, especially if you're a runner in need of some muscle TLC, I highly recommend Siam Massage at the Grand Diamond Hotel. Don't forget to check for their happy hour discounts for an even more rewarding experience!	Did one hour foot massage. The environment was nice and relaxing. Masseuse pressed well especially at the soles. It was painful but enjoyable. I felt relaxed and sleepy. After a long day of walking with tired legs, after this massage i felt much better.  Apparently there was a small happy hour promo of lesser thb 50 as we arrived before 8pm (promotion will vary of  course), so my massage cost thb 300 and they also provided tea. They also were not greedy about the amount of tips we gave (at least not in front of us).  Not bad to go if you are shopping in the area, such as at platinum mall or at December's.	Was at the new trending Live Streaming shop December this afternoon and wandered into this massage place just off the hotel lobby.  Decided to give this a try after dinner and really no regrets. One of the best massage place in the Pratunam vicinity.  Clean and well spaced. Told them I need a good strong massage and what I got was possibly the best I've ever had in Bangkok.  Why?? This male masseur makes it his responsibility to ensure that I'm rested and rejuvenated.  Recommended. 	Very good!  Massage.  Go during happy hour and its 50 bhat cheaper.  This is by the lobby of the Grand Hotel next to Platinum plaza.  It is a good place to go after a long day of shopping and walking.  I highly recommend it as it is cheaper than most places and the therapist are excellent! 	The masseuse was not skillful and gave me a “light” massage despite me requesting for harder one. Further, instead of the 2 hours massage that I paid for, 500 baht, I had 1hr 45mins. Cut short by the gentle masseuse.  Two stars, the massage environment was clean and the price was reasonable.	If ur feet is frying from the massive shopping at Platinum mall u can just head next door to grand diamond by level 2 link bridge or ground level to this place. Just few steps from the reception/ lobby of the hotel. The staff skills are good it’s our 2nd time back. They emphasise alot of calves n even thigh. Not using any tools, just bare hands. It’s a no frills place but the chairs are comfy u can even do back / head massage on it. Come before 8pm u get happy hour discount of about 50thb onwards. Their 1hr foot is at 300thb includes some time on head n back n cracking up after hot salt compress. 1hr n viola u get more than expected! 	Amazing & affordable massage!!  We came by for a 1hr foot massage and now fully satisfied!! It was so good and feeling super refreshed right now.	Had a very good massage in this place last year as sponsored by my sister. Hope to go back to this place. 	Very good massage 💆‍♂️ 😍 👌 … 	Massage was a bit soft, but it was fine. Took the body scrub package as well, not that bad. Feels so clean and refreshed 	One of the pricier massage parlours around the area. But pls do not mistake price for good service. We were there for a massage and it was subpar at best. Weren’t offered any tea after the massage service either, which is typical of other massage parlours we have visited around the area.  It wasn’t a very enjoyable massage for us either. 	Very satisfying 1 hour foot massage, definitely will stop by again when I'm in the area 	Standard has been dropping. Besides it having a good ambience, dim, big chairs and good aircon. The masseurs are really disinterested. Even my friend who likes light massages had to ask for a harder massage. Drinks served are less than ordinary. The pre massage foot wash was also like a simple rinse. Price has increased but massage quality dropped.  Not coming anymore.	Thought of giving this place a try despite the multiple bad reviews and true enough they deserve a one star. The masseur is distracted and massage very softly. Politely told her to press harder slightly and she ignore me and proceeds to press down with all her strength. Told her that it’s too pain and again got ignored with no acknowledgement. To anyone reading this review, please give this place a miss. 	Tried thai massage overall I feel is very good experience and service is good 	Our group of 5 were staying in the Grand Diamond Condo and discovered this gem just next door… we’ve had the full body Thai massages, Head, Neck and Back massages the next day and we will be back for another one before we leave Bangkok. Very clean facilities, Staff are lovely and friendly and the massages have been too quality, no slacking at all.  Thoroughly recommend. 	Massage was cut short to 50mins, instead of 1 hour. We paid for 1 hour booking but they only massaged us for 50 minutes. The rest of the 10 mins was tea time?  Don't bluff me please, we been to different massage shops and ONLY your shop "shorten" massage time to customer. This is consider cheat already 	Massage was ok, a bit too soft. Male masseur was coughing without wearing a mask. The male front desk was however very helpful and could have been 5 stars if not for the massage and coughing masseur 	My family and I went for a two hour massage session, and most of us had inconsistent masseuses who kept chatting throughout the entire session. Although the rates are cheap, the massages were not strong enough (overheard other patrons make the same comment as well). A real disappointment given that the reception staff were lovely and the atmosphere was quite calming. 	Paid for 1.5hour massage but only provided 1.15 hour, “eat away” my 15minutes. Massage is okay but come at your own risk, look out for timing
