I went for the aromatherapy massage for 90 mins and my masseur was pretty good (especially if you like massages with lots of strength put into them). I do feel that their body oil is way too oily though. A companion of mine felt that their experience wasn't that good though, so I guess it's largely luck-based.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return as I just think that spending a bit more to get a much better experience is more worth it. 	Highly recommend: Signature 5 in 1 massage,  we so enjoy with the full body relaxable time here! 	We had a siamese full body aromatherapy massage for TBH1,590 (90min). My masseur was exceptionally good at massaging the knots out of my shoulders but for other parts she was so-so. I thought it was a little weird how my masseur didn't wash my feet before the massage but I guess that's their protocol because my companions also experienced the same. My masseur could have benefited from being a little more refined though; for example, instead of gently lifting the cloth off my eyes, she just yanked it off. Also, she yanked the cloth off my chest without any warning, and I admit I was a bit shocked when that happened. All in all, it was still alright though, thus the 4 stars! 	Was looking forward to a massage so we took the 5in1 package. But we were so disappointed.  Inconsistent strength. Inexperienced masseur and masseuse. All 3 of us got the same thoughts Not worth the dollar. One of the worst massage I ever experienced in Bangkok. Definitely not coming back again.  One more star for them because they gave us immediate slot when we walkin without reservation during public holiday at 8.30pm. 	it’s my first time to get Thai massage in Thailand and it was the best massage I got so far. Looking forward to coming back here. Staffs and therapist are very friendly. will recommend this place. :) 	Very good massage, 2 hours herbal stone was great. Very good choice. Extremely friendly staff 	Had the signature 5 in 1 massage. Highly recommended! Only downside is the 1st floor room is not soundproof so even though the room is very quiet, I could hear the noise in the reception area which is just beside the room. Oh & also everyone walking by can see you, so it’s not that private :/  Can only use prompt pay & cash! 	Great location and real easy to find. Very comfortable place to have a relaxing stay. Booking 90-min foot massage - a great choice if you have a long-distance shopping walk. Also we have hot tea after the massage which is very sweet. 	Shop was clean and staff were nice people. Three of us had for the massage and all three were very satisfied. It was an hour-long massage , but the treatment was very thorough. I’ll back soon. 	Very good massage. The shop is beautiful and clean. The price is reasonable for the location.  Highly recommended.♥️♥️😘😘😘 … 	This is good place. You’ll find the prices. It’s a little more higher, but they providing extra therapy and extra massaging technique. 	Great massage at a reasonable price, with a nice clean environment. Service is good too! 	The best 90mins Thai massage ever!! Miss Ta literally healed me🥹🙏🏾 Thank you so much for such a great experience and your hospitality. See you again 😍 … 	I had a stunning 90 mins massage here. The staff is very friendly, recommended! 	I visited Thai Thai Massage at Siam twice in June 2023 for a neck, back, and foot massage, as well as a foot massage. The ambiance was calming, and the massages were relaxing. Arriving early is recommended to secure a spot before it gets crowded after 9 o'clock. Overall, a pleasant experience deserving of four stars. 	The best massage I had throughout the trip (and we visited several massage places!). If it weren’t for the fact that it was our last day in Thailand, I would definitely come back. What I really like is that you have the choice to add 15 minutes of a hot herbal compress or Thai balm if you’d like. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing; I actually fell asleep during the massage. You can request the intensity of the massage, depending on how hard you prefer it to be. 	the best massage in Thailand! Had a good and relaxing time. Definitely will come back again! 	I request for "3 in 1", it's the dry massage to shoulders, neck, and the back for 2 hours. I LOVE IT!!! and I'm gonna come back next time for this. I don't have rocky shoulders & neck anymore. 	Love the ambience and massage here, will definitely come back again, clean and cosy ambience, friendly masseur and staff ! Lovely pleasure 😍😍 … 	Great service! Had the Siamese Aromatic massage and it was great! Highly recommended.
