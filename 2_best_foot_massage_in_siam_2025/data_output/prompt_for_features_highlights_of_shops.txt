The 90minutes foot massage was magnificient, I fell asleep, and my legs recovered from sourness. Massage staff name is Ya, very professional. I will visit again.ü§ó ‚Ä¶ 	It was such a great experience to book a massage at Pela Thai Massage to cap off your Thailand trip. They treated me really well! I enjoyed my pampering session. They had modern facilities and expert therapist. I‚Äôll be back on my next Thailand trip! 	We enjoyed a one and a half hour Thai Traditional massage here. The experience was wonderful, with a friendly reception welcoming us upon arrival. The room was clean and had a quiet setting, making for a relaxing and rejuvenating massage. Thank you very much!üôèüèªüòä ‚Ä¶ 	I paid 650 for 90 min. It‚Äôs clean and relatively new inside. A bit cramped even and the first floor. Massage was good and soothing but she was light even though I ask for more strength. Nothing outstanding but they accommodated all 5 of us without an appointment. Average I would say but with Thai massage, even the nicest place with a bad masseuse can ruin the experience. I just didn‚Äôt have a good one here. If you like one, note her name and keep going back to her. That‚Äôs how you do it. 	A good massage place to go to. The masseur really massaged out the tension and knots in my shoulders. The environment was also really amazing - one of the best I've been to! Zen and relaxing. 	Best massage in Thalian so far!  Staff are friendly and experienced and salon is very clean.  Highly recommend	Very good massage. Very friendly staff, nice and clean places. Very recomended üëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	Amazing Thai Massage place! Booked for the 5 of us (via Klook) and reservation was seamless. The Staff were very accommodating and friendly. The lady who did my massage was very strong and friendly and made us tea afterwards.  Would highly recommend. üôÇ	This is a very relaxing massage and spa place. The facilities are so nice and look like Japanese style. The massage helps me relaxed my muscles a lot. I would recommend this place. 	I've been traveling for 20+ days so my body was entirely hurting specially my feet, after this massage I feel good as new. The service was amazing, everyone is really nice, the music and the smells are really soothing. It was the best massage I've ever had! 100% recommended. 	Excellent massage and service! Booked for 3 people and the receptionist was able to accommodate us. I purchased the Pela Signature Relax package. Without having to explain, the masseuse was able to identify problem areas quickly and loosen up the tension. The space is clean, relaxing, and welcoming. Highly recommend and will definitely return for more massages! 	Awesome service! Very nice and clean environment. Although it‚Äôs a bit pricier but it‚Äôs worth the price.  Brought my baby along and did the 6 in 1 therapy and it was so comfortable. The other lady came out to help me take care of my baby while I enjoy my massage which I greatly appreciate. ü•∞ü•∞	Relaxing massage and totally enjoyed it. Opted for the aromatic massage, 90mins with 1 for 1 promotion at 1,650 baht which is definitely a steal! Place was clean and quiet as well. Highly recommended. 	Wonderful experience!!!! All the service are good, the massages will keep confirming you are ok or notüëç Definitely will come back again!! ‚Ä¶	Truly amazing massage. They are dedicated to giving the best massage experience. Just a warning for foreigners. It will hurt during it, but afterwards you will feel amazing and relaxed. 	Comfortable and new environment. Massage was great! Would come back 	Super place!!! My husband and I did the "Aromatherapy oil massage with herbal compress" 60min and it was super nice!!. Worth it 100%. All the people was very nice and they offered us a hot th√© after the massage. The girl on the front desk was very kind and helpful (her name was Jane). ;) 	I book last minute & and managed to get the earliest shot .I have tired foot and aunt ling assign to me.The receptionist are very friendly and nice.Highly recommended. Aunt Ling skill is not too hard or too softly when press the pressure point .Too comfort till I fall asleep. 	Came over here with friends after a busy day of walking around Siam Square. This place is professionally decorated and super clean  was surprised that it is a few floors inside. Chose the aromatherapy package and it was a wonderful respite and relaxing massage experience. Therapist was skilled and hardworkin. Manager and owner were friendly.  Highly recommended and would definitely visit & come to this place again. 	Thai massage never fails to please me.  I chanced upon this place on Google map while in the area Siam Sq. Atmosphere: nicely decor as in pics. Very ZEN, nice,clean,tranquil,spa feeling, not just a massage place. Soft music,dim light. We had couple room. Technique: had a Thai body massage .The masseuse applied right amount to ease my muscle tension. Very polite even though she doesn't speak much english. Price: very affordable compared to other Thai massage place, with those interior. The receptionist speak english well. When i left, there was full house with people doing foot massage.

I went for the aromatherapy massage for 90 mins and my masseur was pretty good (especially if you like massages with lots of strength put into them). I do feel that their body oil is way too oily though. A companion of mine felt that their experience wasn't that good though, so I guess it's largely luck-based.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return as I just think that spending a bit more to get a much better experience is more worth it. 	Highly recommend: Signature 5 in 1 massage,  we so enjoy with the full body relaxable time here! 	We had a siamese full body aromatherapy massage for TBH1,590 (90min). My masseur was exceptionally good at massaging the knots out of my shoulders but for other parts she was so-so. I thought it was a little weird how my masseur didn't wash my feet before the massage but I guess that's their protocol because my companions also experienced the same. My masseur could have benefited from being a little more refined though; for example, instead of gently lifting the cloth off my eyes, she just yanked it off. Also, she yanked the cloth off my chest without any warning, and I admit I was a bit shocked when that happened. All in all, it was still alright though, thus the 4 stars! 	Was looking forward to a massage so we took the 5in1 package. But we were so disappointed.  Inconsistent strength. Inexperienced masseur and masseuse. All 3 of us got the same thoughts Not worth the dollar. One of the worst massage I ever experienced in Bangkok. Definitely not coming back again.  One more star for them because they gave us immediate slot when we walkin without reservation during public holiday at 8.30pm. 	it‚Äôs my first time to get Thai massage in Thailand and it was the best massage I got so far. Looking forward to coming back here. Staffs and therapist are very friendly. will recommend this place. :) 	Very good massage, 2 hours herbal stone was great. Very good choice. Extremely friendly staff 	Had the signature 5 in 1 massage. Highly recommended! Only downside is the 1st floor room is not soundproof so even though the room is very quiet, I could hear the noise in the reception area which is just beside the room. Oh & also everyone walking by can see you, so it‚Äôs not that private :/  Can only use prompt pay & cash! 	Great location and real easy to find. Very comfortable place to have a relaxing stay. Booking 90-min foot massage - a great choice if you have a long-distance shopping walk. Also we have hot tea after the massage which is very sweet. 	Shop was clean and staff were nice people. Three of us had for the massage and all three were very satisfied. It was an hour-long massage , but the treatment was very thorough. I‚Äôll back soon. 	Very good massage. The shop is beautiful and clean. The price is reasonable for the location.  Highly recommended.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò ‚Ä¶ 	This is good place. You‚Äôll find the prices. It‚Äôs a little more higher, but they providing extra therapy and extra massaging technique. 	Great massage at a reasonable price, with a nice clean environment. Service is good too! 	The best 90mins Thai massage ever!! Miss Ta literally healed meü•πüôèüèæ Thank you so much for such a great experience and your hospitality. See you again üòç ‚Ä¶ 	I had a stunning 90 mins massage here. The staff is very friendly, recommended! 	I visited Thai Thai Massage at Siam twice in June 2023 for a neck, back, and foot massage, as well as a foot massage. The ambiance was calming, and the massages were relaxing. Arriving early is recommended to secure a spot before it gets crowded after 9 o'clock. Overall, a pleasant experience deserving of four stars. 	The best massage I had throughout the trip (and we visited several massage places!). If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it was our last day in Thailand, I would definitely come back. What I really like is that you have the choice to add 15 minutes of a hot herbal compress or Thai balm if you‚Äôd like. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing; I actually fell asleep during the massage. You can request the intensity of the massage, depending on how hard you prefer it to be. 	the best massage in Thailand! Had a good and relaxing time. Definitely will come back again! 	I request for "3 in 1", it's the dry massage to shoulders, neck, and the back for 2 hours. I LOVE IT!!! and I'm gonna come back next time for this. I don't have rocky shoulders & neck anymore. 	Love the ambience and massage here, will definitely come back again, clean and cosy ambience, friendly masseur and staff ! Lovely pleasure üòçüòç ‚Ä¶ 	Great service! Had the Siamese Aromatic massage and it was great! Highly recommended.

I was not disappointed!  Taking advantage of their happy hour discount, I indulged in a full-body Thai massage for only 300 THB. As an avid runner, I especially appreciated the attention given to my calves, thighs, hamstrings, and forearms ‚Äì areas that often bear the brunt of my training. The therapist skillfully worked on these specific muscle groups, easing tension and leaving me feeling rejuvenated.  Beyond the targeted muscle work, the overall experience was fantastic. The air-conditioned room provided a welcome respite from the Bangkok heat, allowing for complete relaxation. The therapist was professional and knowledgeable, ensuring a comfortable and therapeutic session.  If you're seeking a quality Thai massage in Bangkok, especially if you're a runner in need of some muscle TLC, I highly recommend Siam Massage at the Grand Diamond Hotel. Don't forget to check for their happy hour discounts for an even more rewarding experience!	Did one hour foot massage. The environment was nice and relaxing. Masseuse pressed well especially at the soles. It was painful but enjoyable. I felt relaxed and sleepy. After a long day of walking with tired legs, after this massage i felt much better.  Apparently there was a small happy hour promo of lesser thb 50 as we arrived before 8pm (promotion will vary of  course), so my massage cost thb 300 and they also provided tea. They also were not greedy about the amount of tips we gave (at least not in front of us).  Not bad to go if you are shopping in the area, such as at platinum mall or at December's.	Was at the new trending Live Streaming shop December this afternoon and wandered into this massage place just off the hotel lobby.  Decided to give this a try after dinner and really no regrets. One of the best massage place in the Pratunam vicinity.  Clean and well spaced. Told them I need a good strong massage and what I got was possibly the best I've ever had in Bangkok.  Why?? This male masseur makes it his responsibility to ensure that I'm rested and rejuvenated.  Recommended. 	Very good!  Massage.  Go during happy hour and its 50 bhat cheaper.  This is by the lobby of the Grand Hotel next to Platinum plaza.  It is a good place to go after a long day of shopping and walking.  I highly recommend it as it is cheaper than most places and the therapist are excellent! 	The masseuse was not skillful and gave me a ‚Äúlight‚Äù massage despite me requesting for harder one. Further, instead of the 2 hours massage that I paid for, 500 baht, I had 1hr 45mins. Cut short by the gentle masseuse.  Two stars, the massage environment was clean and the price was reasonable.	If ur feet is frying from the massive shopping at Platinum mall u can just head next door to grand diamond by level 2 link bridge or ground level to this place. Just few steps from the reception/ lobby of the hotel. The staff skills are good it‚Äôs our 2nd time back. They emphasise alot of calves n even thigh. Not using any tools, just bare hands. It‚Äôs a no frills place but the chairs are comfy u can even do back / head massage on it. Come before 8pm u get happy hour discount of about 50thb onwards. Their 1hr foot is at 300thb includes some time on head n back n cracking up after hot salt compress. 1hr n viola u get more than expected! 	Amazing & affordable massage!!  We came by for a 1hr foot massage and now fully satisfied!! It was so good and feeling super refreshed right now.	Had a very good massage in this place last year as sponsored by my sister. Hope to go back to this place. 	Very good massage üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòç üëå ‚Ä¶ 	Massage was a bit soft, but it was fine. Took the body scrub package as well, not that bad. Feels so clean and refreshed 	One of the pricier massage parlours around the area. But pls do not mistake price for good service. We were there for a massage and it was subpar at best. Weren‚Äôt offered any tea after the massage service either, which is typical of other massage parlours we have visited around the area.  It wasn‚Äôt a very enjoyable massage for us either. 	Very satisfying 1 hour foot massage, definitely will stop by again when I'm in the area 	Standard has been dropping. Besides it having a good ambience, dim, big chairs and good aircon. The masseurs are really disinterested. Even my friend who likes light massages had to ask for a harder massage. Drinks served are less than ordinary. The pre massage foot wash was also like a simple rinse. Price has increased but massage quality dropped.  Not coming anymore.	Thought of giving this place a try despite the multiple bad reviews and true enough they deserve a one star. The masseur is distracted and massage very softly. Politely told her to press harder slightly and she ignore me and proceeds to press down with all her strength. Told her that it‚Äôs too pain and again got ignored with no acknowledgement. To anyone reading this review, please give this place a miss. 	Tried thai massage overall I feel is very good experience and service is good 	Our group of 5 were staying in the Grand Diamond Condo and discovered this gem just next door‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve had the full body Thai massages, Head, Neck and Back massages the next day and we will be back for another one before we leave Bangkok. Very clean facilities, Staff are lovely and friendly and the massages have been too quality, no slacking at all.  Thoroughly recommend. 	Massage was cut short to 50mins, instead of 1 hour. We paid for 1 hour booking but they only massaged us for 50 minutes. The rest of the 10 mins was tea time?  Don't bluff me please, we been to different massage shops and ONLY your shop "shorten" massage time to customer. This is consider cheat already 	Massage was ok, a bit too soft. Male masseur was coughing without wearing a mask. The male front desk was however very helpful and could have been 5 stars if not for the massage and coughing masseur 	My family and I went for a two hour massage session, and most of us had inconsistent masseuses who kept chatting throughout the entire session. Although the rates are cheap, the massages were not strong enough (overheard other patrons make the same comment as well). A real disappointment given that the reception staff were lovely and the atmosphere was quite calming. 	Paid for 1.5hour massage but only provided 1.15 hour, ‚Äúeat away‚Äù my 15minutes. Massage is okay but come at your own risk, look out for timing

Although not the cheapest I‚Äôve seen in Bangkok, this is right outside the Icon Siam mall which makes it very reasonably priced if you want other options besides the massage places inside the mall. My masseuse was great and put appropriate pressure on the stiff places on my back. I would recommend to anyone. Even a complimentary cup of green tea when you are finished. 	My favorite place in this area for a foot massage (finishing with neck and shoulders). When I was in Bangkok 2 1/2 years ago and quite pregnant, I came every day. I came back in today and it was still great! Efficient but effective, smells good, clean, comfortable chairs. I prefer the casual massage shop experience over a fancy spa for a foot/leg massage, so if you like that too, give this one a try. 	Very clean and comfy! definitely a place to return! and good massage which I'm not a person who like massage. just next to iconsiam (turn left when u exit from siam street food floor) within 1min walk 	The overall atmosphere of the massage parlor was rather ordinary. When I checked their price list, the front desk service felt unwelcoming, especially compared to other establishments in Thailand known for their hospitality. I was also uncomfortable with their policy of requiring payment upfront before the service. This can make it difficult for customers to address any dissatisfaction with the service. The therapist was eager to meet my expectations and repeatedly checked in to ensure the pressure was satisfactory. However, despite her efforts, the pressure was not sufficient. For those seeking a strong foot massage, consider this when choosing your therapist. 	Clean and relax place for massage. Staffs are all so friendly. Reasonable price, 650baht for Foot + Oil massage, the masseuse is attentive with skills. she speaks softly, but does not understand Eng very well.	Very good relax massage, thank you üôèüèª Lucky and happy are very cute ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶ 	Great massage! Better than the rest we‚Äôve tried. The lady on the right, which I forgot to ask her name, is really good. Btw there‚Äôs a really cute white cat in the shop too! Will definitely come again on our next visit to Bangkok! 	Lovely massage and customer service! We popped in without any kind of booking and they immediately accommodated us with a smile. We opted for 90 minute aromatherapy massage and were shown to a private couples room complete with  shower facilities. The massage was so relaxing and attentive. Therapists so professional and kind. After we paid and left my wife realized she had misplaced her necklace but they were quick to find and return it! 	Nice massage spa nearby the huge shopping mall. Good prices being in Bangkok riverside area. Cleanliness and professional staff. Look for the white furry sleeping cat!	When your staying near Icon Siam Mall and want to get an authentic thai massage you should try this place. Me and my wife came back for a second time.  Place is clean and staffs are friendly and massage therapist are expert in providing an authentic thai massage 	üôÄOmg our trip in thailand oct 2023 around 1 week. We been doing massage for 4 places including pattaya, floating market and bkk.  üò≥Turned out, we found this one to be the best!! 9/10/2023 P Pu and P nut really are expert!! They really did make us feel so impressive and relief from pain. It really a very good thai traditional massage. 2 of us get a very good massage and 2 hrs only 550 thb. We really recommend and appreciated their time, kindness and expertise.  ‚è∞Only 5 mins walk from Iconsiam  üôèüèªThank you! And to the shop owner! P Pu ‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏π and P Nut ‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏ó really make us want to come back again!  ‚úÖTotally worth it üòçü•∞ 10/10	Me and my husband came to do it and they finished the massage 15 min before the right time an didn‚Äôt care when we said. Very very disappointing 	Feet, neck and head. 60min. - Location. We looked for one after leaving IconSiam. The street is full of massage places so we went in in the first one that looked ok. (4.2 Google reviews.) - Facilities. Clean and tidy. - Massage. Feet: At times ok, at times not enough pressure. Had to tell her to do it stronger. Neck. She stood up on a bench behind me and put pressure on my shoulders with her whole body weight. It wasn't good. 20 minutes after finishing i started to have back pain due to supporting her weight in a bad position. Head: did not feel comfortable. Also nails were a bit long.  Summary: They have many masseuse in the store, so i was unlucky and got one with less skills. I would not recommend it based on my one time experience. And i can understand now why there are so many 5 stars and a decent proportion of 1 star reviews. 	Very relaxing. Quiet environment with plush chairs. I got a foot, neck, head massage for 300 baht and the pressure and technique of the masseuse was great. 	Very bad experience For the person in charge(a young lady) already showed black face to us when we are deciding which massage to do  May be because of song kran festival? The massage staff said already do 7 customer today, very tired  And she demonstrated a very rude manner, even throw the towel to my body‚Ä¶ seems like I done something wrong to her, depriving her rest hour I guess? And the skills is bad as well  Definitely won‚Äôt come again‚Ä¶ the worst experience ever in Thailand 	Very affordable and great masseuses. Other places in Bangkok are more expensive and not as good. I would rather travel to here than spend more elsewhere 	After we shopping in Icon siam we go to do massage thai with blma they are good massage we recommend this shop Cute 	It‚Äôs the best experience in Bangkok! And there‚Äôs a cute cat! 	Avoid Avoid‚Ä¶ when they were giving the massage it was weak and they didn‚Äôt put their heart into the massage. after finishing the massage their hand was at the door getting ready for us to leave. the worst massage i‚Äôve ever experienced. really disappointing‚Ä¶. 	Neck and Foot massage was great. Can recommend

The mango sticky rice at the end is so good too. 	My first choice for massage in Thailand. Visited at least once every time I‚Äôm in Bangkok. Professional masseur. 	Very convenient location in the shopping mall, with nice and helpful staff. The massage was really relaxing. Highly recommended! 	Exceptional service with the highest quality products! A refreshing warm pillow for your comfort. Conclude with hot towels and body lotion. Five-star luxury level! 	Amazing massage experience with this BTS platform view from Siam. Service is good as always. And there are signature mango sticky rice after your massage refreshment ‚ú® Lovely day with Let's Relax! Definitely come back again.	Good massage session with Khun bunyawadi at Lets Relax, its outlet @Siam Square One Nice reception welcome and complimentary mango dessert with herbal tea. 	Great place just below moxy hotel where we stayed. Staff were friendly and masseuse were good too. Place is aesthetically pleasing and not those dark massage parlours that make me feel a bit creeped out hahaha I also like that there are rooms and not just curtain dividers. Highly recommend!	Been coming here since 2022 & I always go to Let‚Äôs Relax every Thailand trip since then. Photos below are actually from all my trips and you can see I really enjoyed my time. I suggest to go with Thai massage for first timers & book in advance so that you can secure your slot (at least 24 hours). :)  Will come back on my next trip to Thailand!	I had the dream package, which is so far the best quality/price value. Adequately priced, and clean. The massage highly depends on masseuse. That said, most of them are wellqualified i think. 	It is always wonderful experience here! The masseurs are always up to our standard! We came here once a day! Highly recommended! 	**Terrible Experience at a "Reputable" Massage Shop - Stay Away!**  I recently visited this highly-rated massage shop, but my experience was shockingly awful. The masseuse lacked any proper technique or strength ‚Äì it felt like I was being lightly patted rather than receiving a real massage. To make matters worse, her attitude was dismissive and unprofessional throughout the session.  **The worst part?** After the massage, she outright **demanded** that I give her a "5-star rating," instructed me to "leave with a smile," and warned me not to "cause trouble for her." This blatant attempt to manipulate reviews is not only unethical but also deeply offensive.  Do **not** waste your time or money here. This place prioritizes fake ratings over genuine service. Save yourself the disappointment ‚Äì avoid at all costs!	Since discovering Let‚Äôs Relax, we always choose it over other massage places in Bangkok. Reservations are a must, and what continues to impress us and keeps us returning is the delightful mango sticky rice served after the therapy session! Mango sticky rice is a Bangkok essential!  The aromatherapy sessions are conducted by female masseurs who ensure you're fully relaxed with a shower before their skilled techniques soothe your soul for a blissful 60 minutes.  Currently, the Aroma Oil Massage is priced at ‡∏ø1,300.	It's my first time coming here and I had a wonderful experience. The staff were very accommodating,friendly and professional. I feel that my body was so relax. definitely a worth going if you are here in Thailand and I will come back soon. 	very good ambience . Receptionist are friendly and polite.  Good Massage 	My wife and I went for a 2 hour aromatherapy massage. I was attended by Ms Punnisa. This is one of the best therapeutic massages I have ever had - she kneaded all the major muscle groups with professionalism. She knew where to apply pressure.  The welcome tea and the mango sticky rice at the end of the treatment were nice touches!  Highly recommended, I‚Äôll be back for sure! 	Nice facilities. When you arrive they give you wet towel for the face but the towel was dry and not cold. Spacious room with private shower. Heated massage beds. We did the warm oil massage in room for couple. Everything was clean and relaxing. Would appreciate it if the masseurs will not talk between them during the massage. 	Exceptional service and care at Let‚Äôs relax Spa! The staff were kind and welcoming, and my therapist was highly skilled. I felt completely relaxed and at ease with city view included. Highly recommend! 	I booked my massage on the wrong day by mistake and totally missed my appointment but they answered my email within the day and changed my booking for me without fuss. üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  The massage rooms are so clean and the entire experience feels really lovely, from the start till the end, where they serve you mango sticky rice hahahah. Def returning.	Located at level 6 Siam Square 1 which is just next to the BTS. Very nice decor and atmosphere. Prices is a bit steep. Very friendly front desk staff. Serves mango sticky rice for dessert after the massage. Massage was OK with the right pressure and attentiveness. 	I feel relaxed and rejuvenated after the massage. Definitely coming back!! Highly recommended!!

Totally loosen up after a day of work, traffic and walking around the city. 	I was looking for a massage on Christmas Eve and came across Lek Massage Bangkok - Lek Foot Massage. I opted for a 1.5-hour aroma oil massage, and it was the best decision! My therapist, Frank, was exceptional. He truly knows how to apply the perfect amount of pressure, ensuring every part of my body felt relaxed and rejuvenated. Frank‚Äôs expertise in making me feel completely at ease is commendable‚Äîkudos to him for such outstanding service! The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the massage and the overall experience. I will definitely be returning to this wonderful place on my next visit to Bangkok. Highly recommended! 	Foot massage was average - I wasn't too satisfied with my massage to be honest. But was just glad I could find a place as all other massage places nearby were fully booked. 	Clean place, received a bottle of water after our session instead of tea and price is a tad on the expensive part. 	Unfortunately I did not enjoy much with the massage. I am male and they assigned make person for my massage without asking my preference.  The male used too much power which was painful to me. He also massage the chest which normally doesn‚Äôt happen, that too after opening my shirt. That was not nice. I did not really feel relax with the massage  Good thing about this place is they speak English, and it is modern and clean. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt enjoy my massage	I went to Lek Massage to do foot massage on 2 days. I paid 350 baht for a 1h foot massage. I could pay by cash or card without being asked for extra charge. The strength was good and the masseurs did not talk among themselves. I appreciate this aspect as my pet peeve is when the masseurs talk among themselves and disrupt the serenity of the ambience. I observed that Lek renovated since I went there 2.5 years ago, Pre-Covid days. 	I recently had a wonderful experience at this place. While I can't recall the name of the male masseur, his skills were truly exceptional. From the moment he started massaging, he seemed to intuitively know the sore parts of my back muscles and skillfully focused on those areas without me having to ask. His ability to identify and address my specific needs was impressive. The massage itself was fantastic. The pressure was just right, and he expertly worked out the knots and tension in my muscles. I would highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a skilled and attentive message therapist. 	We have a good relationship with them. The first day of massage was them, and the second day was also theirs. They are very kind and their massage skills are also great. I will visit Lek Massage again when next time I go to Bangkok ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è 	Recommend by my friend Tried the Foot massage last night and today tried the oil massage Very impressed with the skill of the masseuses I got, foot was Kate and full body was Nam.. especially Nam she really tried to loosen all the "blockages" yet not harsh when you show pain. 3 days of intensive walking and shopping.. this is really rewarding... Price wise also very reasonable.. hope the next time I come, she is still around.	Had a full body oil massage given by a wonderful lady named Phat. I appreciated every minute of the massage and I loved the tonicity and strength of it. Thank you Phat. 	Me and my husband live in Thailand and went there to try the 1h foot massage.  My massage lady gave very soothing strokes of massage although not focusing on the acupuncture points.  My husband however was entirely dissatisfied with the service. The lady did not have any strength at all and just moving her hands here and there like tickling. He asked for more professional service but to no avail and halted the service before the time was up.	Everyone wants safe massage zone. and quality insurance. Lek try to SHA. Good time for me. Foot 1hour + Head and shoulders 30m 500THB. Little bit expensive than Local shop but Safe and Clean. 	sorry,worst massage i had in Thailand Just seeing as a foreigner, assign me a lazy massager , tickle ? touching ? They dt know i speak Thai , I'm just here to survey which massage shop for my coming work trip . Sorry definitely not you Speak bad behind customer  Sorry no again.	My therapist was a new employee with little to no experience. I paid 1600 baht for an aroma massage and was essentially getting a back rub. When I reminded her that this was a full body massage, she ran out of the room! The manager came in to see what the problem was and I told her the same thing. She sent in a different therapist and she did a good job. Only two stars because they should have provided more training to new staff before letting them work on customers! 	I did aroma body for 2hr, nice experiemce and clean enviroment.  Lots of tourists but no need advance booking.  It seems they have many outlets all stone throw from each other.  This one is directly opposite side door of Novotel Siam Square Hotel.  Will sure be back again. 	Extremely noisy and rushed foot massage session. My foot wasn‚Äôt dried properly after the foot bath and made to walk to the massage chair in a pair of sticky slippers.   I had many noisy tourists walking in front of me as they arrive for session / left after their session . Will never set foot into this marketplace place again 	Massage is ver bad , Not recommend to try here at all, The massage wasn't to the point at all. And staff they didn't focus to the customer, seem like pay money for nothing 	The body massage I‚Äôve experienced at this location isn‚Äôt good. The masseuse started off really light and after I asked if it‚Äôs possible to increase in strength, he straight up applied pressure without skill. Overall, the massage wasn‚Äôt up to standard and this fact is amplified by the price. I visited this chain because I had a good experience in another location. 	Fantastic massage n very good service! No wonder it‚Äôs my fav place for massage when in bangkok.	Avoid this joke of a place. What a scam. I paid 30 mins for Head Back massage and they only did 20 minutes. Lady spent 5 minutes adjusting the chair, 5 minutes left me waiting and ended early. Doing the calculations again, massage was only 15 minutes since she ended it so early. Waste of time. Any other chain is better. What a scam and they were so rude about it.

The moment I stepped in, I was greeted with a relaxing scent and calming music. The staff were so friendly and welcoming!  I chose the 30-minute foot massage package and honestly, it felt like I was walking on clouds afterward. Pure heaven! If you feel as relaxed and happy as I did, I highly recommend tipping the staff‚Äîthey really put their heart into the service.  Highly recommend if you need a little escape and recharge during your trip!	Great location next to Siam BTS. Staff were friendly; place was quiet and clean. The massage was on point and I fell asleep during the massage.  Free small bottles of water are available. You would receive a cup of tea and some little sweet snacks after the massage. 	Had such a great experience with the measure Vee and the staff over there. Massage was so good, relax and right point. Moreover, I forgot my ring and they tried to call me to give it back. Highly recommend 	Went for their 1hr foot massage (400baht) and it was really good value for money.  Payment is upfront and they take you upstairs to a quiet room with a comfortable reclining couch. Staff appear technically skilled with the right amount of force applied.  They serve you hot tea at the end with tiny cookies. Would consider returning even if for an impromptu visit. 	The massage itself was great - but the intense noise of the streets cancels out the relaxing music and therefore the atmosphere altogether.  We added a manicure, that - to be completely honest - was disappointing . Once again not the service (the staff are friendly and do take care of you) but the results.	Went for Thai massage with 3 other friends, and another did shoulders massage (she felt it was okay, not bad). Our Thai massage was not bad too, however felt that the masseuses were a bit too chatty among themselves. They seemed to be also laughing in front of us and talking in Thai that we gave too little tips. 	U need to emphasize if u want deep (harder) massage. They can do well if they want to so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not giving it all 5 stars. I believe must use heart in all customers. Priced slightly higher than those on the same row. But overall the environment is clean n pretty new. Nice having salt scrub before Thai massage. So maybe try my luck w another masseur next time haha.. 	Always go to Lek massage at Phrom Phong and never had a bad experience there, though this branch at BTS Siam was horrible. Went with a friend so they put us in one room, masseuses were always talking between each other and rushing through massage like they were rather doing us a favour and not doing the job we paid for. Also, we asked for jasmin oil but they used another. In general the impression was super unpleasant 	I visited the bts siam lek Massage branch with my wife .. Body scrub and aroma oil massage was good for both of us . We asked for head massage in addition to the prebooked body massage. But head massage was horrible for both of us and they charged 200 baht each. 	Wasn't pleased with the massage itself and was way too overpriced for service received. Clean and modern facilities however. 	I had an office syndrome massage for 1 hour and as soon as the therapist started it I regretted it.  The technique was soooo bad. It's like you ask a family member to massage you and they just randomly start pressing on your shoulder, neck, head area without any order and technique. And it's considered too expensive just for this.  The only decent thing was the place. It's clean and they change the face cover.	Used to come here all the time at Siam branch whenever I am in BKK and the standard have dropped a lot esp since they renovated. An old customer from 15years ago, I think it is time I find another place for massage. Girl at the reception was rude and unwelcoming, made a funny face and made some comments in Thai . Lady who massage my foot seem to be only rubbing oil on my legs. Think any child could do the same! My hubby also had a bad back after while the guy who massaged him tried to force a stretch and cracked his back. 16/4/24 	What I like about Lek Siam:  üòé No mandatory booking required, handy to go to a quick massage after shopping nearby  üòé Reasonable pricing. Download app and you can enjoy different level of discount  üòé Responsive, patient and friendly reception desk to guide first time customer  üòé Therapist K. Nok is very experienced and friendly. I tried her Head and Shoulder massage for 1 hour, and it's a great cure to my office syndrome üòá	place is nice and clean. really liked the upstairs room they took me to for the foot massage. i did a 30 min foot massage for 350 baht. massage was not that good because she just rubbed oil on my legs for the most part. not much technique used. this was my first thai massage. my boyfriend can massage my feet better than this. however the atmosphere and vibe was very relaxing and staff members were decent.	K done my eyelashes. He was very professional and attractive. He paid attention to detail. I was happy with the result. Yes the place is more expensive then others but as a personal choice was good decision. 	Worse massage ever. Paid for one hour but walked out after 30 minutes. Asked for refund but was denied. Wast of 400 baht. 	Reception was playing a video game and more interested in the game rather than helping. Massage felt very rushed, with quick and inconsistent movements. 	The masseuse I was assigned was good! Had a good foot, head and shoulder massage at this place! Love it! 	This place seems to only welcome foreigners. It's sad to see that when it comes to fellow countrymen, they cannot be bothered, even though we paid the same price. The masseur kept looking at the clock as if he couldn't wait for the hour to end. Forget about the quality; at times, it was too soft. When you ask for it to be a little harder, they almost break your bones. Overall, the service is poor, rude recipients, and the massage quality is subpar. It may be convenient for foreigners staying around here, but nothing else is good. Certainly not going to return or recommend	Amazing place all in one for excellent massage and to get nails done. I had the most amazing Gel nail polish done along with the manicure. I was super impressed. All the people are really hard working and go for perfection! Highly recommend if you are in the neighbourhood. I left with baby feet.

Highly recommended! Located in the basement of Fortune Town Mall. Try to avoid evening hours as it can get quite busy 	üò≥ Generally very good massage.  At least when not full of loud Chinese.  Prices better than most places. ‚Ä¶ 	I ordered a shoulder, neck, and head massage.„ÄÄThe masseuse massaged my upper back for 45 minutes.„ÄÄI'm sure He can do a normal Thai massage, but He doesn't seem to know how to massage  shoulders, neck and head. He didn't massage my shoulders, neck and head at all, and I endured it for 45 minutes lying on my stomach, but then I told him about cancel the massage and told the grumpy old lady at the counter what I had.. I had to put up with the disgusting 45 minute massage on the same area, but I paid 100B... 100B for an uncomfortable massage...  Dont go here!  owner never trained their staff. 	We had the 60min foot massage for 180baht and it was much better than places with double the price on soi 24. Many male masseuses here who do a very good job, strong massage and focus on feet. We would always come back here. 	I go for massage regularly and I know within the first 5 mins that the masseuse knows nothing about massages. It was the worst massage I've ever exprienced ! literally just rubbing the oil all over in circles without method nor targetted steps.  I left before time up as it is sickening to be rubbed all over. Complained to the counter and they still charge me. Its nothing short of cheating if customer has to pay for an old lady who knows nothing about massage but just rubbing all over in circles continuously  4 of us had oil massage and basically everyone was highly dissatisfied and felt taken for a 'rub'. Like marinating in oil. 	I‚Äôm a frequent visitor to this massage shop, located on the ground floor of the mall. Prices are much lower than elsewhere in Bangkok, with a foot massage for just 180 Baht. Skilled masseurs and a welcoming atmosphere make it highly recommended. 	I have been here for couples of times, it‚Äôs good for money for foot massage and a rest, but last time I had shoulder and neck massage, I was not happy with the male masseur kept playing on his phone while massage until I told him not to do. 	Very disappointed. I ordered foot massage. I have never seen so unprofessional massage ever. 	Worst massage ever! First the therapist (don‚Äôt think she even deserve this title) has no idea what she were was doing or meant to be doing. She just sit there ‚Äútouching‚Äù or moving her hand on me, but not actually ‚Äúmassaging‚Äù.  Secondly, she finished her therapy earlier than expected ( paid for 90mins but she finished at around 80 mins and lied to her supervisor that we have already finished)  Please don‚Äôt go here unless you are looking for nightmare	Went on sat 3 Feb for a body scrub massage together with my partner. Was attended by an old lady. Speaking in Thai language to her please focus more on my neck. But she ignored it. She massage skills was so bad that I don‚Äôt feel great at all. Others then the old lady . That‚Äôs a guy working there just open my door while we‚Äôre still having massage. How can he come in just like this while my partner and I were just wearing the paper undergarments provided by the shop. Not recommended. Totally unacceptable. 	The worst massage from a guy who kept coughing and didn't know what he was doing. Keep going down n on the other side of the mall hallway there is a massage place that is 20 bhat more expensive, but WAYYYYY BETTER	I go here regularly and think it's good value for money.  Mostly had good massages, but it all depends on the masseuse.  There are a number of massage shops on the ground floor of fortune town but this is the one I come back to if I'm in the area. 	At first the service is goodÔºåbut when the staff massage my headÔºåi told her can harder.but she didn‚Äôt respond and told to her workmate in Thai,i don‚Äôt understand Thai language,but i heard some word‚Äôs about harder,and that sounds not kindly.and when my arms put on the rong location,she judged me rudely by her hands. I don‚Äôt wanna come again,and if u wanna come can choose carefully‚Ä¶ 	At first the service is goodÔºåbut when the staff massage my headÔºåi told her can harder.but she didn‚Äôt respond and told to her workmate in Thai,i don‚Äôt understand Thai language,but i heard some word‚Äôs about harder,and that sounds not kindly.and when my arms put on the rong location,she judged me rudely by her hands. I don‚Äôt wanna come again,and if u wanna come can choose carefully‚Ä¶ 	Reasonable price. Only 160 Baht per hour for Thai massage, 200 per hour for thai massage with oil. 	I opted for 1.5-hour session.  Price is affordable.  Masseur mainly focus most of the time, massaging on the leg and thigh area but very less on the upper back and neck.  (not very balanced).  My Masseur has the strength but it really depends on which masseur you met that day (depends on your luck).  They have thai style shirt and shorts for you to wear.  For myself, I wore an underwear  with the shorts on.  My masseur speaks very simple english but not very fluent.  Overall experience is ok for the price. 	I got a foot massage for an hour, and I thought it was heaven. A man of normal height gave me a massage, and I was very satisfied. If I visit Bangkok next time, I am willing to come again. 	Super value!! 180 baht one hour message. Massage pretty good at this price! 	Valued for money massage , price are lower than any massage store in bangkok 	Had thai massage from male masseur for 90mins but he had body massage only 50mins he had facial and shoulder massage another 40mins with sleeping üò¥ haha  masseur sleeping when he did massage and he touched my face but I knew that he just had smoking  can smell  so bad experience i think bangkok massage quality really so bad now  many places massage wasnt good

I had the most disappointing experience at this massage center. The receptionist was unfriendly, which set a bad tone from the start. Despite clear instructions to maintain silence and keep phones on silent mode for a relaxing environment, the staff kept chatting loudly, their phones were constantly ringing, and a buzzing machine kept going off, making it impossible to relax.  The foot spa and pedicure were equally disappointing‚Äîthe water was not warm enough, and the service was below average. I also had serious concerns about hygiene. While they claimed the manicure and pedicure tools were sanitized, I saw my pedicure tools being put back into the toolbox without proper cleaning, which made me doubtful about their hygiene standards.  Overall, a terrible experience.	Was delighted to find a massage parlor within walking distance from my accommodations. Unfortunately, the only positive thing about Lek Massage is the location; easy to spot and near to BTS (National Stadium). I went for a foot massage (SGD 18) and the staff there was not skillful at all. The whole session was very uncomfortable and ticklish. I would never patronize again.	Don't believe the good reviews. I went for an one hour massage $650. All I got was a towel on my back with techniques of push , elbow and squeeze massage. After 20 I had to leave.  Pillow had a bad smell and the towel gave me a bad itch. They still charged me $550. Don't go there. 	Went to Lek massage house twice during my 4D3N stay as it was conveniently located next to our hotel at National Stadium BTS. The booking via the Lek massage app was easy and straightforward, it also allows you to check for available time slots which makes planning easier. As first-time app users, we were offered 50baht off as welcome voucher.  Services that I tried: Thai massage + aroma oil massage (120mins) Foot massage + shoulder and back (90mins)  Recommended therapists: Imm, Pla & Pat.  The receptionist at the counter was so-so okay. Payment to be made before the service and both days we were on time and waited <15mins for the masseuses to arrive (no biggie). I‚Äôm a massage lover who appreciates a bit of aching and pain during the process. And the masseuses‚Äô strokes were firm and consistent throughout the session.  My body felt totally refreshed and ache-free again from all the walking and shopping. Thank you. 	I went for a foot massage twice with my family, the first time the foot massage was okay. The second time I was truly disappointed. Firstly the receptionist at the counter doesn't even care to explain about the services. No politeness at all. She is only ready to show the amount on the calculator, payment first and then the services. 450 Bhat for 60 minutes foot massage no worth at all. The massage therapist does a massage as if she is doing us a favour. They speak to each other and body shame the customers. I could easily understand their behaviour. No empathy at all. All the staff at this branch needs to learn communication skills asap. Than you. P.S: highly recommend Sukhumvit 11 lane foot massage. They do the foot massage diligently and worthwhile the charges. Just at the start of soi 11. Thnk you.	Place is very cramp and small. Guests are seated close to one another or in open area where human traffic r heavy with no privacy. Depending on where u r seated, u r either too cold or too warm fr the lack of aircon. Some of the masseuse talk too loudly among themselves n r not as good as the ones in Lek other outlets. Overall a lackluster experience. Will not be back. 	Made an appointment prior and staff ensured that staff were present to start massage. Massage was relaxing and good. 	One of the many branches of Lek Massage chain of stores. Lek massage has many different massages to choose from. Recommended. 	Nice and clean place close to my hotel. Friendly staff. 	We went into this shop to get a massage and they accommodated both of us and our requests. They were nice and professional.  I took a Thai massage and the masseuse destroyed me ( in a positive way ). They respected the full hour and gave me water and cookies on my way out.  Thanks Lek team! 	Booked 1 hour foot massage for 6 pax and all of us are disappointed. The masseurs don‚Äôt seems interested to put in any effort for proper job, very unlike other Lek outlets. Will not revisit this shop ! Never ever 	Therapist was very powerful and skilled.  Completely rejuvenated after Thai massage with herbal compress.  Thank you Orm 	The service is good. The staff are lovely and give very good advice. I like the aroma oil massage. 	This is my third massage here and always love it. Great price and quality, fully recommend 	Relaxing and calm environment. Good and relaxing. Very friendly staff. Well recommended. 	I never have good massage from this branch at all‚Ä¶its near my house and i wanna give them a chance‚Ä¶but every time i was there‚Ä¶it end up with bad experience.. 	Not a good traditional Thai massage. There are many better places in the area	Robotic, repetitive and half hearted. You will get that limited sequence throughout the entire session no matter the duration you choose. If you really had to visit, choose the shortest duration. 	I went to this massage parlour as it was near my hotel and it was raining. I enjoyed the 30 minutes leg massage. The masseuse was skilled and I enjoyed the massage. Staff were friendly and polite, reflecting the Thai culture. 	Not too bad but not quite value for your money. You can get a better massage from a small place a side street for B200 less. Nice shop and interior though...

Place is a little run down. Very bright, people walking pass while you massage. 2nd floor also not very clean environment. Massage so 	My girlfriend and I get a lot of massages and we can say that if you are staying I. Bangkok and want a professional massage with amazing friendly therapists then Na Siam Massage in Bangkok is number 1.  Located right next to Siam Paragon in Siam Square the shop is extremely clean and has a very relaxing feel from start to finish.  We want to personally thank Mr Chu (photo) and P Cee who were absolutely marvellous and over 20 years massage experience.  Wish we could take them back to Australia with us.  Thanks again and we look forward to visiting next time we are back in Bangkok. 	I had an amazing experience at Na.Siam Massage! The authentic Thai oil massage and foot massage was incredibly relaxing and exactly what I needed. The staff were not only friendly but also highly skilled and well-trained, ensuring a professional and soothing experience. The atmosphere was calm and inviting. I highly recommend!! 	Got massage at this place more than 2 yrs back and I came looking for it this time too as it was of very high quality. Had a hard time finding it but finally here I was!  It's just beside the Siam BTS and also has small interesting market in front of the place.  The quality is still the same and had a very good massage. They have a big room upstairs for full body massage. Also has reduced the cost probably due to pandemic. Unbeatable for the price.  Also went to mbk level 3 massage center the other day. Quite crampy and only a small room. Not ideal at all for all the usual Thai massage maneuvers! Will come back again. 	Pleasant and clean place to have massage after a long day in BKK. Prices are more reasonable than some of the nearby ones. Staffs are friendly too. Recommend üôèüèª‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚Ä¶ 	You have to take a chance and it'll depend on who you'll get as your masseuse. Some are really good, some are just ok. However they did the whole 60 minutes and it was worth the money paid. 	Male therapists r horrible. I visited twice within one week with my fds, just because of the package is cheap.  However, I don‚Äôt understand why the therapists will ride on my body during massage (included front n back side). This is horrible and heavy.  Beside that, their skills are nice, this is the only reason I visited twice.	Oil massage for 60mins. The therapist skills is good, but don‚Äôt know why she was sitting on my legs when massaging the back, she is so fxxking heavy! Beside that, the environment is not really good and super noisy. 3 stars is go for her skills. 	Chance upon this place, did couple Aroma Oil Massage in a private room.  Easy to secure booking, although it was full at that point in time.  Masseurs were nice, with decent techniques.  Shop maybe a little old, but definitely return for massage.	This was one of the best massage Ii ever had after a long day of shopping near Siam area. They had some of the friendliest and the most professional masseurs, especially my preference is on prefer male masseurs who just knew those right pressure points. It is my go-to place whenever I come back to this second home of mine. By the way, do look for khun Chong if your prefer soothing male hands. 	Very good massage excellent skills really good experience excellent.üòçüòå ‚Ä¶ 	Thank you DAO and M & Patty for arranging the massage for us since our 1st of the trip! Very thankful üôèüèª and they rlly can arrange properly for everyone :) ‚Ä¶ 	I did Thai massage. The lady sat on my back. They provided a pillow, so you had to either had to rest left or right side on the pillow. She put her entire body weight on my back when she moved side to side and after 1 hour my right neck was hurting. It was better not to massage at all then to be hurt after that. Terrible!!  Beware tourist! This place buys reviews! All the tourist gave bad reviews. Only ‚Äúlocal Thai‚Äù gave 5 stars.	The worst massage, depend on the person who provide message, the one I had is basically touching my leg. 	Bad experience. -Basically just apply the oil without proper massage pressure. -The guy non stop talking to a female massagist sitting next to. -The worst is he keeps make fun of another elderly male massagist. At the end he ask for TIP‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think the bad service deserve tip lazy staff and not professional	Reasonable prices though still a tad more expensive than places further out. Had a foot massage which was done well and painfully relaxing. The problem is the layout where the cashier and waiting area is lined up face to face with those in the massage chairs. So it became like a noisy fish market as this waiting talked loudly, disturbing any semblance of tranquility. If only people were more considerate like the Japanese who would whisper or avoid talking while others are trying to relax. 	Really bad when I compare the Thai massage i had on a Sunday night. Really really bad!!!! Edit to downgrade further from two to one star after finding out from my wife. ... Pls avoid!! 	Worst massage experience. Will not come back or recommend to others.	Perfect üëçüèΩ will come back definitely. Don‚Äôt look at the reviews, the therapist for me and my girlfriend were great. Fixed my muscles and relaxed the body. Highly recommend üôèüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Although the masseuse was friendly, I felt not enough pressure in my foot massage. I had to tell her to massage my foot after she spent about 20 mins on my calf, which is really not needed. I should have read the reviews before i tried this place, but i was desperate for a massage for my very sore feet. Went in sore. Came out still sore, just with more oil on the feet. Such a pity
