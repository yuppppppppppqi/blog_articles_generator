So relaxing and fresh.they are so kindly giving good services💕 … 	Best massage I ever had. Therapist Su was extremely professional and gentle during my 3 hours massage. Dis body scrub, aroma & face including steaming room. Came out like a new born baby. The receptionist Wee was very helpful and knew exactly what I was looking for. Speak very good English 👌🏼 Next time in Pattaya definitely I’ll be back. Thank you very much for your excellent service. See you soon! 	Nice and clean spa, great stuff. Just if you not used to thai massage like me, then need to be very clear to be extremely gentle. During massage I felt few times like the lady will break me and was painful, but I have to admit, it felt super easy after massage., all body felt nice. 	This place is the best I have been so far (3 months in Thailand). Real professionals, so clean en beautiful and relaxing. It looks super expensive, but it is not, it is just reasonably priced and worth it all. 	this my second trip in pattaya. every time i stoped in this place. I love it. this trip I stop twice within a week because my back problem  I took combo set first time and aroma massage for the second. thanks to Sky. she knows what she doing. 	Very sweet and polite staff and the spa experience is one of the best ! Would highly recommend to anyone in Pattaya . 	Definitely need visit. It was overbooked and need pre-book in 	We had great experience,  awesome thai style environment with good staff 	The staff was very polite and one of them speak fluent mandarin. I did foot massage and given neck and hand massage at the end for about 10 mins. It was a pleasant experience and the massage was great for a reasonable price. The place is also very clean. 	Very clean facility at a reasonable price , I took 3 hrs in 1 day , So fantastic 😍  Clean , good service and good price  Super High quality Recommend, I wil come back again for sure 100000000% 	Very bad. Missed reservation and more than 30 minutes waiting. I don’t want to visit this massage anymore 	You can easily book the massage with kind staff is speaking english with call. Massage was good and therapist has good skill of muscle relaxation. You can choose time of massage 60, 90, 120 and price is also resonable. 	Massage was not at all up to the mark. It is like they just rub oil on your body plus the there was no aroma in the oil used. The tea served after the massage was cold. There was no attention to customer satisfaction. By looking at the ambiance you will feel as if the place is good but the quality of massage is really not at par. 	The best massage in Thailand. Very professional, clean place, relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended!!! 	Good spa & good health I recommend 🥰👍🏻 …	For me No.1 in Pattaya for spa and Massage. I went to many places @Sea Spa so Wonderful place here , Prices and Therapist very good here ,I will come back again for sure.👍👍👍👍💕 … 	I really in love here the Therapist so nice and polite, The Receptionist speaks 3-4 languages.  My Combo Set 1,450 THB very good for me and for my husband Body 💕 Body Scrub and Aroma gold Set .  Super perfect 👌 Highly Recommend.
