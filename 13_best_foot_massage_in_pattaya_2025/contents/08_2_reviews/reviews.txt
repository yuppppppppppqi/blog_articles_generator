Therapist <strong><u>Su was extremely professional and gentle</u></strong> during my 3-hour session. Left feeling like new!
Thanks to <strong><u>Sky</u></strong> and her expertise! My back problem felt much better after the combo and aroma massage.
Looks luxurious but <strong><u>prices are very reasonable</u></strong>. Real professionals in a clean, beautiful, relaxing setting.
The receptionist <strong><u>Wee was very helpful</u></strong> and spoke excellent English, guiding me to the perfect package.
Such <strong><u>sweet and polite staff</u></strong>! The spa experience itself was one of the best I've had.
Loved the <strong><u>awesome Thai-style environment</u></strong> and the great experience provided by the good staff here.
Very clean facility, and the massage skill for <strong><u>muscle relaxation was excellent</u></strong>. Easily booked via phone.
For me, this is the <strong><u>number 1 spa in Pattaya</u></strong>. Wonderful place with good prices and therapists.
The Thai massage felt a bit too intense and painful at times, although I did feel better afterwards.
My massage felt more like just oil rubbing; didn't feel the therapist had great technique or focus.
