RINN Spa/Massage
・Rating: 4.2
・Price: Mid-range (value perception varies significantly based on individual experience)
・Recommended: Those prioritizing a visually appealing spa environment near Alcazar, but be aware that massage quality can be hit-or-miss.
Right opposite Alcazar, RINN Spa catches your eye with its <strong><u>beautiful, modern, and clean interior</u></strong> – a welcome cool escape. The staff generally offer a friendly welcome, often with tea. Some therapists, like New, really know how to find those sore spots, and their unique "Modern Thai Massage" blend sounds interesting. However, it feels like a bit of a gamble; experiences really vary. Some people rave about their massage, while others felt the technique was lacking, the service felt rushed, or the atmosphere wasn't quite peaceful due to noise. Paying upfront is standard here. It's a pretty spot, especially convenient for Alcazar, but be prepared that the <strong><u>actual massage quality might be inconsistent</u></strong>.
