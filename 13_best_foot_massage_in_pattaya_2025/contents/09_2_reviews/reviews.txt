<strong><u>Sao gave an outstanding massage</u></strong>, relieving severe neck and shoulder tightness. Incredible skill and strength!
<strong><u>Nong is a favorite therapist</u></strong>; she always adjusts the massage based on what I need that day.
Fantastic <strong><u>value for money</u></strong>! Professional massages at prices like 150 baht per hour are unbeatable.
<strong><u>Natalie was amazing</u></strong>! Provided great quality, customized massage with no funny business. Very friendly shop.
<strong><u>Sri really knows her stuff</u></strong>, focusing on painful areas. Went back every day during my 3-day stay!
Left with <strong><u>increased range of motion</u></strong> after my massage. The lady knew exactly where to apply pressure.
The <strong><u>body scrub was great</u></strong>, and the traditional Thai massage experience felt very authentic here.
Despite being a small shop with older equipment, the <strong><u>massage quality and friendly staff</u></strong> were excellent.
Massage was okay, but the therapists chatted quite a bit amongst themselves, which was a bit distracting.
Received a normal Thai massage when I paid for the more expensive head and shoulder specific one.
