The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home. The customer service was outstanding, and I appreciated how attentive they were to my needs. Although the place is small, it has a cozy and inviting atmosphere. I opted for a two-hour massage, and it was absolutely worth it. I left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated! Highly recommend this gem! 	I was here 2 days in a roll doing 2 hrs Thai oil and the next day foot and oil. Very nice company and the massage is definitely worth the price. Will come back again 	Highly recommend Wipada Massage. It’s not on the busy tourist roads but is well worth to go and find it. The massage was fabulous and professional. Wipada is safe and friendly. I will definitely come back and recommend you get your next Thai Massage at Wipada. 	I recently visited a delightful massage salon, and I can't say enough good things about my experience! The foot massage was incredibly soothing, relieving all tension and leaving my feet feeling rejuvenated. The Thai massage was equally amazing, combining stretches and pressure techniques that really helped release muscle tension. The atmosphere was calm and inviting, with friendly staff who made me feel welcome throughout my visit. I left feeling relaxed and revitalized! Highly recommend this place for anyone in need of some pampering! 	Went as 3 pax when I visited Thailand recently. One of my companion wasn’t very satisfied with her massage (too soft).  But it was a great experience for me. The space was cosy, massage was great for me, 1 of them can speak English, the price is very value for money too. Free water after massage as well. 	Found Wipida Massage by googling Sports and Deep Tissue massage. What a superb place. Small shop and unassuming but I was lucky enough to have the owner of the business Wii massage me. I have some muscular issues in my back and left shoulder and Wii gave me probably the best deep tissue (proper ironing!) massage I’ve ever had. What a nice lady too. I am booking a second appointment. I thought the price would be 800 to 1000 bhat because so professional unlike so many massage places with pretty girls who know nothing about either massage or the human anatomy. Wii asked for 500 bhat after 90 mins - so I gave her 800 as that was the min value of this great massage. If anyone is staying in Pattaya and needs a really top notch pro massage this is the place. 5 Stars!! 	Wipada the owner and staff are very friendly. It was a very relaxing massage. After the massage, Wipada recommended me an online taxi which is much cheaper and faster. She is very helpful. 	I’ve visited this massage place in Pattaya twice, with about six months in between, and both times I was very impressed. It’s honestly one of the best massages I’ve had in Thailand (and I live in Thailand for almost three years now). The therapists are skilled and provide a strong, effective massage that left me feeling relaxed and refreshed. I really enjoyed both experiences and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality massage in Pattaya. 	Incredible massage!! I did the one hour Thai Massage for 250 baht and I feel amazing now! Will definitely come back 😍😍😍 … 	Best massage ever!!! Thank you so much! Great , professional staff! We’ll definitely come back again:) 	Top quality and relaxing massage, better than I expected and will come back! Lovely team of ladies too 	Had a thai massage, the staff were friendly, the prices were good, very good experience overall. Would come back again for sure.	what a fantastic  find this was , a great massage. The ladies were very professional  and friendly. I will return 	Very good massage. Lovely owner. If you want to have massage with a professional massagist, ask for Pami. Helped me very much to get relief from my inflamations. 	Just had foot and a Thai massage best massage since 2005 .Will going back again.Also good price as well 👍 … 	It's a small shop, but it offers great service. If you only want to get an accurate massage, I recommend it. It's a great and kind place if you just want a massage to relieve your fatigue. 	Excellent message 🤩  Had some back pain that needed a " proper" deep tissue massage .    Was very happy with the massage and could feel my back improve the next day .    thank you to Ms Wee for a very professional massage .
