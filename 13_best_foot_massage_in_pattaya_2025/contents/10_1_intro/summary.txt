・Rating: 3.9
・Price: Budget-friendly (Standard low prices like 200 THB/hour)
・Recommended: Shoppers needing a quick, affordable, and convenient foot massage near Central Festival. Quality can be inconsistent, especially for other massage types or regarding therapist professionalism (phone use/talking reported).
The biggest draw here is its <strong><u>super convenient location right next to Central Festival Mall</u></strong>. It's a large, generally clean space with comfortable chairs perfect for a quick foot massage after shopping. Some find the atmosphere relaxing, and the foot massages generally get decent feedback for firm pressure at standard budget prices (around 200 THB/hour). They don't pressure you from outside, which is nice. However, experiences can be inconsistent, especially for Thai massage (which can be very strong) or regarding therapist professionalism – some have reported staff using phones or chatting during sessions. It's primarily a <strong><u>handy, affordable option for tired feet</u></strong> near the mall.
