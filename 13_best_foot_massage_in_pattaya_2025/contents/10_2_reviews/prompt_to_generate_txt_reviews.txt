Right new to Central Festival Mall.  Easy access for everyone.  2. The entrance was clean and swept.  The workers were not seating outside and hassling anyone for business.  No one was being pushy….just the opposite- everyone was well mannered and very polite.  3. I did not feel a ‘yuk’ vibe.  This place is PRO…it is not sleezy.  The whole experience(my wife went with me)…was very good.  4. Working uniforms were very clean and modest.  5. The leather recliners were new and clean and comfortable.  6. Nice smell to the whole place…a nice aroma filling the large main area.  7. Relaxing music…music that makes you go to sleep in a good way.  8. Pro massage not a painful massage.  9. 200 baht is a super great price!  Awesome for the quality.  Tip your person when you are done, they deserve it.  If you want a great experience, ‘cheap’, good location, not sleazy…this is your place….you’ll leave a happy person.  Peace. 	Shop closes at 11pm instead of midnight now. Below average foot massage, not much strength and not as good as compared to the other options down the street. Standard 200 baht for 1 hour. Spacious outlet. 	I went here with my wife (she also gives massage herself), the shop looked nice and clean, ladies were polite.  Upon entering you immediately get slippers and your feet are washed.  then you go to your place, my wife got thai massage and i got foot massage and manicure.  I finally had someone who gave good firm massage and not just rubbing feet and legs, wonderful!!!  After my wife was done she had the same experience as what I had, good and firm massage.  The prices are normal for pattaya, but here you get more for your money, and of course don't forget to give the ladies a good tip... 	This place is great. There is often a small wait, but it is well worth it. The staff are friendly and professional. Their facility is clean and equipment is in good working order. If you need a good foot massage at a reasonable price, look no further. (I did not experience the full Thai massage and can not speak to that) 	this place rocks. unbelivable prices for the work that is placed to ensure I get a great foot massage.  they should charge $100us for the amount of work n effort here.  love this place and awesome staff!!!! 	There are 2 shops sharing the same name side by side, with different entrances. There was no pressure by masseuses from either side. I went in from the right shop and I was pleasantly surprised by their professionalism. I had a back and shoulder rub and it was invigorating to say the least. It was relaxing and the pressure was just right. No extreme pain. Every move was a good rub and fell comfortable. Extremely satisfied! Only 300 baht for an hour 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 	Good location. Worth the price for 90-min foot massage package at 400 baht only. The staff with good attitude and technique. Contrarily, the staff at another branch inside Central Pattaya were with extremely bad attitude and no one response while I was asking at the reception. 	Had an one hour thai massage. Was quite strong compared to others i had in thailand. But it was great and just right. Rooms are modern and in great shape. Staff where friendly and i had a great overall experience here. 	Woman massaging was using her phone messaging throughout my massage. Didn’t stop talking either. With so much competition you’d think they would be professional. I will not be returning 	Nice massage therapy shop Highly recommend Masseur Ms.Mimii Special Package 90min Foot massage Head Shoulder	A nice and safe place! They have a variety of offerings. Masseuse welcomed me and did not rush me throughout the process. She kept checking if I was doing okay and if the pressure is enough for me. Had taken oil massage and was quite satisfied with it. I think it's a norm to tip these days.. so go ahead and don't shy away! Would visit again 	This is a genuine massage place. I go here for body and shoulder and foot massage. The minimum price is 200 baht but if you go for a package deal you get a discount like we did. Do not embarrass yourself by asking for extra services.  The masseuse are highly trained and experienced for conducting body and foot treatment.  Highly recommend this place. The staff is very friendly. 	Their therapies are slightly costly than similar parlours, but completely worth it.  We took foot therapy and turned out to be very nice.  We tried couple of other parlours aswell and this was the most hygienic and the therapy was good aswell.  Only downturn:  the massage ended 5 mins prior and further, the therapists asked for tip over and above the massage which anyway was slightly costlier 	The best massage parlor in Pattaya. Experienced masseurs and good ambiance. True story. They returned a pair of sunglasses that I had forgotten after a month of loosing them. Very honest. 	For me best  massage  saloon Pattaya. Staf helpful.clean and good massage .Thanks 👍 … 	Terrible massage and a therapist was using her phone through the session. I will not return to this place. 	One of the best. Large, clean facility with good size individual massage rooms, at least for oil massage. Very nice girls/women give very good straight oil massage, 300B.
