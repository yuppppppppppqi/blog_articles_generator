Great location next to the mall. <strong><u>Very professional, clean, and polite staff</u></strong>. Excellent value at 200 baht!
Finally, a <strong><u>good, firm foot massage</u></strong>! Not just rubbing. My wife loved her Thai massage too.
Masseur <strong><u>Ms. Mimii</u></strong> gave a great massage with <strong><u>good technique and attitude</u></strong>. Highly recommend her.
The <strong><u>back and shoulder rub was invigorating</u></strong>! Just the right pressure, comfortable and extremely satisfying.
Very <strong><u>hygienic place with experienced masseurs</u></strong>. Felt safe and welcomed throughout the oil massage.
Appreciated the <strong><u>relaxing music and pleasant aroma</u></strong>. A genuinely pro massage experience, not painful at all.
Staff are <strong><u>highly trained and experienced</u></strong>. This is a genuine massage place, no sleazy vibes at all.
Large, clean facility with <strong><u>good private rooms for oil massage</u></strong>. A very good, straight massage.
My foot massage lacked strength and wasn't as effective as others I've had on the same street.
The therapist kept using her phone and talking during my session, which ruined the relaxing experience.
