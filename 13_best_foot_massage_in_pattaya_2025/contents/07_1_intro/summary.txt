The Sea.Spa offers a lovely escape with its <strong><u>beautiful, traditional Thai decor creating a genuinely warm, quiet, and relaxing ambiance</u></strong>. Tucked away in a quiet area with nearby dining, it strikes a nice balance between basic street shops and high-end hotel spas. Reception and therapists, like Ta and Jeap, are generally noted as friendly and professional. They provide quality massages (Thai, aroma, foot), facials, and body scrubs in private, clean rooms, even offering family rooms which is a plus. While pricier than the most basic options and potentially cash-only, the <strong><u>serene atmosphere and professional service quality justify the cost</u></strong> for many seeking a more refined spa experience.
