From the moment I entered, I was welcomed so kindly. The service is top notch, the rooms are private and nicely decorated.  And the therapy was so professional,  exactly as strong as my body needed it! I would highly recommend this spa any time and I wish I can come back for another treatment! 	Reception was very friendly and accomodating from start to finish. The ambience is very traditional and warm. The prices are very reasonable for the quality. More importantly I had an incredible massage and facial from Ta. It was the best two hours of my life! I can't recommend Sea Spa enough, just go and find out for yourself! Thanks Sea Spa and Ta, I'll be back! 	Had a Thai massage w/ herb balm  500b & foot massage 400b. It was great experience.  I know I can get cheaper experience but it was relaxing & quiet location. I see several repeat customers coming and going so that is a good sign. I would given 5 stars if credit card are allowed considering its one of bigger spa facility. 	I have been  very good and warm service, the staff are smiling bright and giving good advice, very grateful and highly recommend. 	An unbelievably perfect body scrub followed by 1 hour of deep relaxing massage. I went 2 nights in a row. They are a new business nestled in a quiet area at the end of the road. You won‚Äôt regret Sea Spa. 	The facilities weren‚Äôt that good but the masseur (Jeap) was good she had technique to relieve the back pain ‚Ä¶ recommended if you have back pain 	It's too expensive as compared to the market, it's not value to money. Quality of massage is same to other spa center it's better to go there and price is 3x cheaper. It's look like we just wasted extra money here. 	A excellent Thai massage experience I had, my friend was even fall asleep with relaxation. We had a 3.5 hrs package includes body scrub, Thai massage and oil massage, the massage technicians are very professional and kind. Overall very nice experience!! 	I have over 100 massages in bangkok, jontien, hua hin etc but was treated as a new tourist by Aggressive and pushy staff including a firm demand for a tip once the massage started‚Ä¶below average massage..tons of better options but yes if you are a tourist will probably come once as the location is great, hence the 2 stars 	Good service. Thai massage is excellent. I brought whole family to this place. Everybody was excellent of this. 5 stars	‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êrating for 01) cleanliness 02) Privacy 03) Q of massage, 04) Friendly front desk manager and Therapists 05)Ambience. 500 THB Aroma oil massage each for 3 of us (üë®‚Äçü¶∞, üë©‚Äçü¶∞, and üëß). All 3 of us had a family room üòÑ and happy on the service. It may look Pricy but worthy for experience we had . 5 min drive fromTerminal 21. Shall visit to have Combo offer üôÇ.. Parking üöò at road side infront of spa. A caf√© , itallian restaurant in same campus..Hot ‚òï tea after massage..Refreshing!	I really like this place. It has everything. The food is delicious and the price is not expensive. 	A quiet massage and spa nestled in a Thai decorative setting. This place is an actual massage place that does not offer anything special. The masseur I got for my 90 minute foot. Massage was really good. She knows exactly where to fix my tension and is very friendly. I would recommend booking ahead of time because the place can be quite busy.. The receptionist speaks very good English and is very accommodating to your request. 	It is a splendid spa here. Therapist and receptionist are very kind. Facial massage is  really good.	The service is not good enough, especially the receptionist is arrogant. Better not to go! 	The massages were great. It‚Äôs a bit pricier than other options but worth it for the atmosphere. 	The price so good ! clean , the therapist are polite and friendly üëç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üëçüëçüëç quiet environment,not far from the beach, luxury (Thai) house don't miss !! If you in Pattaya.  If you want a better massage than you can get at most massage shops in town, but don‚Äôt want to pay for the high prices of a 5-6 stars hotel type of spa, this is a good compromise , Highly Recommeded üëçüëçü•∞
