Possibly the <strong><u>best two hours of my life</u></strong> thanks to <strong><u>Ta</u></strong>! Incredible massage and facial. Highly recommended.
Received <strong><u>very good and warm service</u></strong> from the brightly smiling staff. Felt welcomed and well-advised.
The <strong><u>body scrub was unbelievably perfect</u></strong>, followed by a deeply relaxing massage. Went two nights consecutively!
Therapist <strong><u>Jeap</u></strong> had great technique and really helped <strong><u>relieve my back pain</u></strong>. Much appreciated skill.
Loved the <strong><u>private family room option</u></strong>! Great cleanliness, privacy, and quality massage for all three of us.
A <strong><u>splendid spa with kind therapists</u></strong> and receptionist. The facial massage was particularly good.
Quiet, beautiful Thai decorative setting. The <strong><u>foot massage was excellent</u></strong>, fixing tension spots perfectly.
A <strong><u>good compromise</u></strong> if you want better quality than street shops without 5-star hotel prices.
The massage was fine, but I found the staff a bit pushy, especially regarding tipping during the session.
Facilities looked a bit dated, not quite matching the price point compared to other spas nearby.
