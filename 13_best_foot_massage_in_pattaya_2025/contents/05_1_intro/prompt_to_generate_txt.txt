They are very good with it and we had a very relaxing 1 hour foot massage. My girlfriend even fell asleep during the process! It's that great! I could not recommend this place enough and will definitely go again for a full body massage! 	I got a Thai Massage from Kathi.  - excellent technique (never experienced this kind of technique before and i had a lot of Thai Massages) - hard riffs - great pressure - knows exactly how to do  100% visit worth 100% recommendation  I will come back!!! 	The reviews are really good here and when we went it was totally worth it! My other half had 2H oil massage that he claimed relieved all his pressure, while I had 1H body scrub (THB 400) and 1H oil massage (THB 300). We did a lot of massages (more expensive) in Bangkok that weren’t as good.. 	Had 1hr Thai masaage with Kati for 200thb which was great!!! It felt no difference than what's in the US for insane 100usd! 	This place is full of the ballyhoo of Koreans and Chineses who like using telephones and talking loudly. You cannot really have a good sleepy while having a foot massage here. The skills of the masseur are quite average. 	Have problems with muscles and tendons in my upper back and shoulders so like to get a massage couple of times a week. I often visit Joy Massage for a back and shoulder massage - usually with 'Dao'. She always does a great job and is very polite and professional. 	I really enjoyed my massage at this small shop.  All the staff were very friendly and they provided a really good deep tissue massage. 	Amazing, ask for Na! Legs never felt better. 	Perfect if youre in search of back pain relief. Experienced personal delivering exceptional massages. 	Unbelievable foot massage! Very friendly 	Great foot massage, super friendly staff Super relaxing, I even almost fall asleep first time on foot massage. Definitely one of the best I've ever had in Thailand 	Have been coming here for a few years now. You always know you will get a great massage here. I even bring my young kids here and the ladies give them a great gentle massage also. Great atmosphere and lovely ladies. See you next time. 🙏🙏 … 	Best massage salon in Thailand!! Ask a massage from Daw and say Pikachu sent you & you will see what great massage you get! Prices are very attractive as well! 	One of the best massages I’ve had, I asked for strong massage and she gave it to me. Foot massage in the chair followed by shoulder & back massage upstairs on a foam mat. Clean premises. Will return 	Excellent massage, will definitely visit again. Very friendly and pleasant staff too. 	Great massage!! We had so much fun, and the price is funny. Recommend! 	Pure & professional Thai oil massage will relax your body. It is good
