The <strong><u>Modern Thai massage was fantastic</u></strong> - a perfect blend of aroma and traditional techniques without harsh cracking.
Beautiful decor and <strong><u>friendly staff</u></strong> offering tea. My masseuse was skilled and professional during the session.
My therapist <strong><u>New</u></strong> gave such a good massage, I extended for another hour! Left feeling completely relaxed.
<strong><u>Clean and cozy atmosphere</u></strong>. The Aroma and Hot Stone massage was a genuinely great experience overall.
Loved how they found my lower back pain points! <strong><u>Effective Thai massage</u></strong> in a very clean environment.
A really <strong><u>good place for a relaxing massage</u></strong>, much better than the average street massage places nearby.
The <strong><u>combination package was amazing</u></strong>. Staff were friendly and did an excellent job. Will definitely return.
Paid upfront, which felt odd, but the <strong><u>Thai massage turned out to be one of the best</u></strong> in Pattaya.
The massage quality was a bit inconsistent; my second visit wasn't as good as the first one.
Ambiance was nice, but some loud tourists spoiled the quiet relaxation I was hoping for during my massage.
