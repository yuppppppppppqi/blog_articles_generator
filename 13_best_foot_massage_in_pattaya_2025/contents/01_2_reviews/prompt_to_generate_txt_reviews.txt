The ambiance is serene, and the staff is exceptionally professional. I was fortunate to have Master Mona as my therapist - her expertise in anatomy and skillful techniques made the experience truly unforgettable. Highly recommended!" 	Took Aroma Oil Massage with Hot Stone with my husband. Actually we intend to do aroma massage only but they gave us promotion of upgrade warm oil with hotstone with a bit of additional only. Very relaxing place too. The location is nearby the beach. Best massage so far in Thailand that I had! ❤️ 	From the moment we arrived, the service was wonderful — the staff were incredibly respectful and warm. The best smiles in Pattaya are definitely here! If you’re thinking of treating yourself, this place exceeded all my expectations. They were especially kind and gentle with my 82-year-old grandmother, which we truly appreciated.  Without a doubt, it’s worth visiting. Thank you for your kindness and warmth. Marina (mom), Mirta (grandma), Malena (daughter) 	Beautiful hidden little parlour designated near the entrance of the busy walking street. It is like a little oasis among chaos, even the loud sounds of the walking street is completely silenced when you close the door. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, all facilities are clean and kept to a very high standard. Staff are kind and welcoming at every point. I am a woman solo travelling, and I really recommend this place. Staff are mostly women which made me feel so safe, it was also a very private building so you can look out onto the walking street but people can’t see you. After your massage you are given a generous plate of fresh fruit and snacks to rejuvenate. For all the ladies, I really recommend the full body scrub - you are left with the softest skin and it really helps to clear back acne and rough bumpy skin on arms and legs. For any ladies looking to feel safe while doing an intimate service such as the full body scrub, I recommend Sai. She made me feel so comfortable!! 	I had Hot Aroma therapy and it was quite amazing experience. She was very professional and experienced. Very good at her work. Much recommended. Please don't visit for happy ending but visit for great massage. 	A very good, authentic and legitimate massage business in the heart of Walking Street. Don't be put off by the fact that it's sandwiched between strip bars and agogo clubs 😂, the rooms are clean and the masseurs are professional and experienced. I had a great 90 minute Thai massage. After which they'll serve you with some biscuits, tea and mango sticky rice 😋 	Don't miss this place. It offers ancient traditional massage. Master Mona was exceptional. She has over 18 years of experience into this science of massage and the positive effects on the body mind and soul are immediately perceivable. Thanks a lot "ONE" for the great service. Would surely recommend this place. 	Feels Heaven after massage PUY had a great hands. Once in a lifetime experience. I recommend take 150minutes massage later u ll be blessed. Compare to this Quality massage 3150bhat is too much cheap. Great ambiance, Ultimate Snacks and lovely fruits. Thanks to each and everyone. Try massger PUY. 🙏 	The place is right on walking street but a very professional, decent hospitable establishment. The therapy offered is amazing.. the best massage I’ve had till date. As a regular massage goer.. I was surprised by how much better it was than the other places I have visited. 	Very nice clean and definitely different than other massage places in Pattaya, you can even charge your phone during massage, they bring fruits and tea after massage, its a bit over priced 	Amazing pure massage. Seriously legit place!! No hanky panky stuff. Had a wonderful massage soothing all the knots and ended with nice tray of desserts and warm tea. Awesome!!  P/s : take the baht bus and stop just before it turn left. Walk straight for awhile and u will see their white and black signboard. Highly recommended 	Massage shop In the middle of walking street! The best shop I ever go. It’s more expensive then the others in Pattaya, but you get the best service, you can be sure! Can recommend to everyone! I will come back. 	Staff is super friendly, top notch massage that actually targets all the pain areas, would definitely recommend coming to this place. Although I will only stay in Pattaya for 4 days, I have already came back here for the second massage in 3 days! 	“I had an amazing experience at this massage center! The ambiance was calming, the staff was incredibly professional, and the massage itself was truly relaxing and therapeutic. Every detail, from the cleanliness to the personalized attention, made it a perfect session. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and completely stress-free. Highly recommend to anyone looking for quality care and a peaceful environment!” 	Very friendly,clean and this place is really recommended..Is a must to come if you all wanna have a relax mine massage.. 	I opt for the 60mins warm aromatherapy massage session and they threw in free hot stone massage too. The whole experience was super comfortable with the right amount of pressure throughout the whole body. Ended off the session with a nice warm hot tea and sticky rice. Splendid service and will definitely return here again when I visit Pattaya. 	Excellent massage with friendly and professional customer service. Highly recommend!
