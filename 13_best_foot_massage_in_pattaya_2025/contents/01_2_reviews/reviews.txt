<strong><u>Master Mona's expertise</u></strong> was incredible; the best traditional Thai massage I've ever had. Truly unforgettable experience.
Felt so relaxed after the Aroma Oil massage. <strong><u>Professional staff</u></strong> and a <strong><u>serene ambiance</u></strong> right on Walking Street.
<strong><u>PUY has amazing hands</u></strong>! The 150-minute session was pure bliss and felt like heaven afterwards. Highly recommended.
Such <strong><u>warm and respectful service</u></strong>! They treated my grandmother so kindly. Made our visit special.
Loved the <strong><u>post-massage mango sticky rice</u></strong>! A lovely touch after a great, legitimate massage.
Felt completely safe as a solo traveler thanks to the <strong><u>private setting</u></strong> and mostly female staff.
The <strong><u>full body scrub left my skin feeling amazing</u></strong>! <strong><u>Sai</u></strong> made me feel very comfortable during the treatment.
Surprisingly professional place amidst the chaos. <strong><u>Great value</u></strong> with the hot stone upgrade promotion we got.
Massage was decent, but the room felt a bit small for the price compared to others nearby.
It was a good massage, though I expected a bit more pressure for a traditional Thai style.
