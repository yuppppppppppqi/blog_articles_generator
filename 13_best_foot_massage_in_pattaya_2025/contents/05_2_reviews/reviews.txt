<strong><u>Kathi gave an excellent Thai Massage</u></strong> with techniques I hadn't experienced before. Great pressure! 100% recommended.
My girlfriend fell asleep during her foot massage, it was that <strong><u>relaxing</u></strong>! Very <strong><u>friendly staff</u></strong> too.
Incredible <strong><u>value for money</u></strong>! The body scrub and oil massage were better than pricier ones in Bangkok.
Ask for <strong><u>Na</u></strong>! My legs have never felt better after the massage she gave. Truly amazing work.
Perfect for <strong><u>back pain relief</u></strong>. <strong><u>Dao</u></strong> is very polite and professional, delivering exceptional massages.
One of the <strong><u>best foot massages I've had in Thailand</u></strong>. Super relaxing and the staff were lovely.
Consistently <strong><u>great massages here</u></strong> over the years. They even do gentle ones for my young kids.
Got a really <strong><u>good, strong deep tissue massage</u></strong> here. Clean place and very pleasant staff.
The massage skill was okay, but nothing exceptional compared to other places I've tried nearby.
It was difficult to relax fully due to some very loud customers talking throughout my foot massage.
