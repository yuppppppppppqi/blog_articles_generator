Finally found an <strong><u>excellent massage</u></strong> in Pattaya! <strong><u>Noi</u></strong> was professional and highly skilled. Worth the extra cost.
Came here for years, the <strong><u>standard is consistently amazing</u></strong>. Most staff have been here long-term.
<strong><u>Nui</u></strong> did a great job locating and working on my stiff back areas. <strong><u>Very authentic Thai massage</u></strong>.
Incredibly <strong><u>good value at only 200 BHT</u></strong> for a quality one-hour Thai massage. Clean and peaceful too.
Appreciated the <strong><u>private rooms and professional atmosphere</u></strong>. No funny business here, just healing massages.
<strong><u>Bokko has special energy</u></strong>! Felt so much better after two sessions with her; she really knows her stuff.
Felt brand new after the <strong><u>rigorous but effective Thai massage</u></strong>. They checked my comfort level throughout.
Very <strong><u>clean place with experienced masseuses</u></strong>. Found them through local recommendations and was not disappointed.
My massage was a bit too strong, even after I asked for lighter pressure. It became uncomfortable.
The therapist seemed distracted and didn't really listen to my request about focusing on specific areas.
