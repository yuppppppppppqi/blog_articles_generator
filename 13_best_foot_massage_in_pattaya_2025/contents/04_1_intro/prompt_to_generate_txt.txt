Location strategic near the pattaya center. My Massesus Mdm Ancharika has very good experience. Backpain and sore hand relief. Dobt forget to enjoy the famius mango sticky rice adter the treatment. Enjoy! 	It was very relaxing and super relief I have received the massage from the staff - I have been a big fan of Let’s relax spa and have tried many branches and always in love with the style and decoration. I totally recommend this if you’re looking for a professional massage and spa. 	I recently visited "Lets Relax Spa"], and it was an absolutely rejuvenating experience. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was soothing, with soft lighting, calming music, and a welcoming scent of essential oils.  The staff was incredibly professional and friendly, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout my visit. I opted for a dreaming package which is a combination of foot, hand and head and sholder, and the therapist was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension while still keeping it relaxing.  The facilities were spotless, and every detail—from the cozy treatment rooms to the plush robes—added to the luxurious experience. After the session, I was offered a cup of herbal tea with mango which was the perfect way to end such a blissful treatment.  If you're looking for a place to unwind and truly pamper yourself, I highly recommend Lets Relax Spa in Pattaya (opposite Terminal 21). I’ll definitely be returning for another session soon! 	Good experience  everytimes i came here. Recommended to all the one who loves massage~ 💕 … 	Professional staff. Quick to attend to you. Nice spaces for a relaxing massage. Massage prices are also very competitive and affordable. They have a website to make booking, but has to be 24 hours in advance. but walk-in is easily available. So I would not bother with the website.  Everyone speaks or at least understands English. I had Thai massage, and the masseuse (suratsawadee) was very accommodating. She listened to me about certain areas that I want her to concentrate more on. She is very skilled. Very accommodating. 10/10 experience. 	Very technical masseuse from experienced therapists. Amazing relaxing soothing experience after walking good 10/15 kms. 	Had an amazing experience at Let’s Relax- the therapists are highly skilled and the facility is clean and very professional and thorough, very foreigner friendly and accessible for people with different languages too as they ask for preferences with tablets. Would highly recommend the Thai massage here! 	While the price is significantly higher than the countless massage shops in Pattaya, you will get a much better experience with a truly professional massage in a relaxed, quiet environment. You should make reservations for this massage. We did a couples massage and it was very enjoyable. Each room has a shower. The session was not rushed. The therapists were professional and attentive. After the massage, we were offered hot tea and mango & sticky rice. It was an excellent experience. If you want a better massage than you can get at most massage shops in town, but don’t want to pay for the high prices of a 5 star hotel type of spa, this is a good compromise. 	Recommended,staff friendly i will come back . 	Looks better than the cheap places but the quality is similar. The massage lady did the same thing as in most of other Thai massage places. They learn the same thing but have no idea what they're doing. Many of the "technices" have no orthopedical nor comforting feel-good purpose. They are just slightly painful but have absolutely no effect. I still give 3 stars because Thai massage places are often in general just bad compared to in Vietnam or Japan for example 	Really positive experience! Beverage before the massage and then mango sticky rice after! Great Thai massage and very relaxing 	I had 2 hour deep tissue massage and it’s good. I was able to nap during the massage and it’s not harsh. It’s clean and in deed comforting place to have your massage  I asked not to use oil since its scorching hot outside, but I still enjoyed it.  The best part is after the massage care. They let you sit in  the balcony while having your tea and mango sticky rice. 	This was one of the best massage therapy places I have ever went. It was absolutely wonderful and I was sooo relaxed. The masseuse was very careful and now all of my back neck and leg pain is gone! ✨👌 … 	5 star massage Very traditional Thai massage Free hot tea and mango sticky rice after massage 😋👍 … 	Very good massage and  therapist Profesional. 	The experience is nice very relaxingmassage👍👍👍 … 	Ambiance and location were great. But reception service is just meh and not friendly. Massage was okay but not the best.
