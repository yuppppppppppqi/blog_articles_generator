The ambiance is serene, and the staff is exceptionally professional. I was fortunate to have Master Mona as my therapist - her expertise in anatomy and skillful techniques made the experience truly unforgettable. Highly recommended!" 	Took Aroma Oil Massage with Hot Stone with my husband. Actually we intend to do aroma massage only but they gave us promotion of upgrade warm oil with hotstone with a bit of additional only. Very relaxing place too. The location is nearby the beach. Best massage so far in Thailand that I had! ‚ù§Ô∏è 	From the moment we arrived, the service was wonderful ‚Äî the staff were incredibly respectful and warm. The best smiles in Pattaya are definitely here! If you‚Äôre thinking of treating yourself, this place exceeded all my expectations. They were especially kind and gentle with my 82-year-old grandmother, which we truly appreciated.  Without a doubt, it‚Äôs worth visiting. Thank you for your kindness and warmth. Marina (mom), Mirta (grandma), Malena (daughter) 	Beautiful hidden little parlour designated near the entrance of the busy walking street. It is like a little oasis among chaos, even the loud sounds of the walking street is completely silenced when you close the door. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, all facilities are clean and kept to a very high standard. Staff are kind and welcoming at every point. I am a woman solo travelling, and I really recommend this place. Staff are mostly women which made me feel so safe, it was also a very private building so you can look out onto the walking street but people can‚Äôt see you. After your massage you are given a generous plate of fresh fruit and snacks to rejuvenate. For all the ladies, I really recommend the full body scrub - you are left with the softest skin and it really helps to clear back acne and rough bumpy skin on arms and legs. For any ladies looking to feel safe while doing an intimate service such as the full body scrub, I recommend Sai. She made me feel so comfortable!! 	I had Hot Aroma therapy and it was quite amazing experience. She was very professional and experienced. Very good at her work. Much recommended. Please don't visit for happy ending but visit for great massage. 	A very good, authentic and legitimate massage business in the heart of Walking Street. Don't be put off by the fact that it's sandwiched between strip bars and agogo clubs üòÇ, the rooms are clean and the masseurs are professional and experienced. I had a great 90 minute Thai massage. After which they'll serve you with some biscuits, tea and mango sticky rice üòã 	Don't miss this place. It offers ancient traditional massage. Master Mona was exceptional. She has over 18 years of experience into this science of massage and the positive effects on the body mind and soul are immediately perceivable. Thanks a lot "ONE" for the great service. Would surely recommend this place. 	Feels Heaven after massage PUY had a great hands. Once in a lifetime experience. I recommend take 150minutes massage later u ll be blessed. Compare to this Quality massage 3150bhat is too much cheap. Great ambiance, Ultimate Snacks and lovely fruits. Thanks to each and everyone. Try massger PUY. üôè 	The place is right on walking street but a very professional, decent hospitable establishment. The therapy offered is amazing.. the best massage I‚Äôve had till date. As a regular massage goer.. I was surprised by how much better it was than the other places I have visited. 	Very nice clean and definitely different than other massage places in Pattaya, you can even charge your phone during massage, they bring fruits and tea after massage, its a bit over priced 	Amazing pure massage. Seriously legit place!! No hanky panky stuff. Had a wonderful massage soothing all the knots and ended with nice tray of desserts and warm tea. Awesome!!  P/s : take the baht bus and stop just before it turn left. Walk straight for awhile and u will see their white and black signboard. Highly recommended 	Massage shop In the middle of walking street! The best shop I ever go. It‚Äôs more expensive then the others in Pattaya, but you get the best service, you can be sure! Can recommend to everyone! I will come back. 	Staff is super friendly, top notch massage that actually targets all the pain areas, would definitely recommend coming to this place. Although I will only stay in Pattaya for 4 days, I have already came back here for the second massage in 3 days! 	‚ÄúI had an amazing experience at this massage center! The ambiance was calming, the staff was incredibly professional, and the massage itself was truly relaxing and therapeutic. Every detail, from the cleanliness to the personalized attention, made it a perfect session. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and completely stress-free. Highly recommend to anyone looking for quality care and a peaceful environment!‚Äù 	Very friendly,clean and this place is really recommended..Is a must to come if you all wanna have a relax mine massage.. 	I opt for the 60mins warm aromatherapy massage session and they threw in free hot stone massage too. The whole experience was super comfortable with the right amount of pressure throughout the whole body. Ended off the session with a nice warm hot tea and sticky rice. Splendid service and will definitely return here again when I visit Pattaya. 	Excellent massage with friendly and professional customer service. Highly recommend!

I ended up having the best Thai massage in all of Pattaya ‚Äî and trust me, I get massages every other day! The staff are super nice and friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to come back! See u soonüòé ‚Ä¶ 	Quite a hit or Miss Place for a massage, randomly passed by and was the beautiful decor and set up of the place, so we got quite impressed. I had 2 massages in the past few days here, but the first one was much better than the second.  Chosen to do the foot, neck & shoulder massage, oddly there was loads of the time contributed to work on my arms and head and barely minutes on my shoulder and neck. I felt okay for the first time, hence the return, but the second left me lingered with not that great of an experience 	It‚Äôs located opposite to Alacazar with small parking lot. I tried the Thai massage was good. I made my 1st attempt here and met a therapist who could find out my pain points at my lower back! It was a great experience and I went there all the time. The environment is clean and tidy although the price is a bit higher than small stores on the streets. 	Beautiful interior at this spa with A/C.  Staff are friendly and they offer tea on arrival. I took the neck/shoulder/foot massage for 90 minutes.  After a foot wash I was taken to the massage chair studio.  My masseuse was very skilled and professional.  There were some loud tourists and staff members which ruined the atmosphere.  My suggestion is to close the doors to the massage chair room and encourage individuals to be quiet and respectful of others.  I was offered tea and a cookie once we were done :) I‚Äôd return the next time.	I had high hopes for Rinn Spa and Massage in Pattaya, given its spacious and neat ambiance. However, my experience fell far short of expectations. Despite opting for a full-body massage with scrub and a lengthy 2.5-hour session including a face massage, the quality of the massage was inconsistent.  Initially, the masseuses seemed competent, but their performance deteriorated after about 20 or 30 minutes into the session. The pace slowed down significantly, and the overall experience was not relaxing. Having tried similar massages in various spas around the world, including Thailand, I can confidently say that Rinn Spa and Massage did not meet the standard.  While the spa's appearance may be impressive, the quality of the massage service does not justify the expense or time. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking a genuinely rejuvenating massage experience. It was a disappointment and a waste of both time and money. 	Close to Runway night market. I went in for 1 hour massage with New, asked for medium hard massage and the massage was so good I extended for another 1 hour. Now I‚Äôm a regular at Rinn Spa, while I‚Äôm on holiday here in Pattaya, leave there fully relaxed after a day of exploring and touring the sites around Pattaya. 	Great Spa Studio. Clean and Cozy atmosphere. Tried the Aroma and Hot Stone body massage and the Head & Shoulder Foot Massage. Great experience overall. Would recommend and would try again if the opportunity comes. 	Such a good place to go get a relaxing massage i would highly recommend to anyone to come here then any of the street massages 100% better and relaxing and couldn‚Äôt stay awake best one ive been to so far 	Amazing massage!  Place was very clean, sheets were new and had no smell.  Highly recommend their MODERN THAI MASSAGE which was a combi of aroma and traditional thai massage minus the intense cracking, tossing and turning. Imagine long, hard, strong forearm and strokes on your back. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è!! 	Amazing and relaxing experience. I got one of the packages, and I will be coming back in the future. The staff are really freindly and do an amazing job. 	Clean place and well design spa in Pattaya, very reasonable price with good massage. Was recommended by one of my friend and worth the try.  Recommended !! 	- Nice and clean place. - Good and welcoming staff. - Professional staff, that knows how to massage.  Will definitely come back. 	I had high expectations, but the experience was disappointing. I booked a 90-minute session, but only received a 60-minute massage. It wasn‚Äôt worth the price, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. 	Very nice ,very polite,very demure Recommended üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª‚ôæÔ∏è/100 ‚Ä¶ 	Very beautiful studio, so prices are a little bit higher than in other studios around. It's my first thai massage, but I think it was good.  Closed room, not curtains. Temperature was also good.  They give me green tea before and after the massage:) 	4 people together. All of us say RINN Super good decoration, disappointing Thai massage. Techniques were poor; (mean and true is their massage feeling like mosquitoes on my skin‚Ä¶) 	I don't want to go again. I don't have good skills, but I get a high price. Whether it's desk staff or owner I don't know, but it's too unkind to the customer I am doing. Use a cheap massage shop nearby  It's a waste of a horoscope

I decided to spend a bit more, and it was well worth it. The establishment is very clean, peaceful, and features traditional Thai massage rooms with soothing music. The masseuse was highly professional, well trained, and provided top notch service. Highly recommended. I‚Äôll definitely be only coming back to her while in pattaya. 	The place is clean and masseuse are experienced. Their rates are competitive. Nui did a great job. Happy with the experience 	Been coming here for 7 years, best massage in Pattaya in my opinion, my wife is an ex masseuse and she loves it here too, the standard is amazing and most of ladies here haven't changed over the years which says a lot about a business 	super worthy ,one hour Thai massage was only 200 BHT , nice place and clean atmosphere. 	üìåMasseuse are very professional, friendly and work there for almost ten years. There are like 20 of staffs there.  üìå Offered private massage room with shower and private wooden sauna room.  üìåThis is the best place to get massage for me when I stay in Central Pattaya.  üìåMy masseuse is Nui but everyone is also great. 	This place is very authentic. By far clean and original experience of Thai massage. After comparison this place stand out for it technique. 	Had great Thai Massage, highly recommended. 	A very cozy massage place that is also a hostel. Really good quality massage, with proper pressure and application. Friendly staff who knows what they are doing.	Highly recommended! So glad we chose this place. We feel brand new!  We each had a 1.5hr traditional and medicinal Thai massage. The staff was highly skilled, courteous, and professional. They communicated with us regularly to check our comfort level.  I would not have chosen this place based on the name but locals on a Thai forum (similar to Reddit) recommended this place, so we came. The owners are strict Buddhist vegans so the staff are rigorously vetted and held to high moral standards. No funny business or happy ending massages here. They will heal you.  If you're not used to the rigor of Thai massages, just let them know. They'll adjust accordingly. Positive Communication, Professionalism	My husband and I went there for few massages: feet, back and thai. We were impressed by ladies professionalism and how good we both felt after. I had a problem with my shoulders and back and the lady was able to locate the stiff areas right away and work on them. Feet massage was exellent and relaxing. The place is very plesant and clean. Overall had a great experience! Recommended! 	In search of a good massage shop brought me by Asian Art Massage. I could recommend this shop for everyone who's in need for a good massage, instead of all the so called "boom boom massages".  The women out here are really professional and even if you tell them that you have an injury they try to do everything they could to take the best care of.  Along Pattaya you have many shops were all the staff sitting outside and saying things like "welcome" "massage" all the time, it is like a bit annoying, this place however doesnt have any staff sitting outside.  They gently sitting inside and don't talk that loud or much to each other, in the shop itself there is even a sign where they kindly ask you to not speak out loudly. The guy who's sitting next to me enjoyed his foot massage so good, that he felt asleep within less then 15minutes I would say.  Again all the women here are really professional and take good care of you. I really really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good massage. And I would suggest that you inform them if you have any injuries they could take care of. 	My girlfriend asked not to do so strong massage a lot of times. The masseuse just laughed at it. It was very painful. She was almost crying. And: no excuses about that! We even said this fact to them, trying to understand why could it be possible. No excuses at all. And this salon seems to be the best in the area? Disgusting. 	I'm coming back to this place for the second time! My first time here was for back & shoulder massage, and the lady tried to work on my muscle knots and pressure points on my shoulder. She knows what she's doing, which is lucky for me since I'm picky about neck massage. My headache and the soreness on my shoulder reduced a lot that evening. 	Absolutely Amazing Team, well trained and amazing hands. Glad I read reviews here, I think place is recently renovated and I was tired after long travel reached before their opening time and they gladly offered foot massage. Even the body massage was perfect. Masses knew each point and works on it. Best Health Massage I had in Pattaya till now. Goin to be there every day of my stay. 	Good massage.. Had 1 hour feet and 1 hour Thai massage.. But Thai massage was hard.. In the end u feel  as if u worked out but relaxed. All in all it is a good way to spend some of your time enjoying the massage before going to party or after a long day of walking around the city. Either way u will feel positive and thankful mentally spiritually and your body muscles relaxed in many ways u did not feel before especially with the Thai massage stretching your muscles and nerves to the limit.. And trust me u will be coming for more next day and the day after that I know I did and the best part is the cheap and fair price your paying for it because this service can cost u 10 times more in your country so enjoy it as much u can while u are there. Don't take it for granted benefit max..talking about myself I am happy I did;I was going to massage places every single day and even there was days I was having massage twice a day and now that I am back home and writing this review I know for sure my money was well spent. Also they have hundreds of massage places with or without happy ending and boom boom it really depends what you want.. so Good luck for you. 	My partner and I went there for 2 hours each for Thai and oil massage. It‚Äôs nice atmosphere with private room but my message therapy is poor of service mind and treatment. She didn‚Äôt listen what kind of massage I asked and of course I am a Thai speaker so language isn‚Äôt a point. The worst she poked me like 3 times to asked me to turn around or lay on my back instead of telling me. Disappointing, it‚Äôs the fist and the last time. 	I guess this is the best spa in this area. Especially because of one masseuse. Her name is Bokko. Highly recommend! She has special energy, maybe you can feel that is it too strong, but nothing worried you on the next day. Trust her, she knows exactly what she is doing. I had a lot of pain before Bokko, after 2 sessions I feel much better, nobody can help me before. It‚Äôs a shame, that I don‚Äôt have  time to stay in Pattaya longer, but now I have reason to come back! Thanks a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

Location strategic near the pattaya center. My Massesus Mdm Ancharika has very good experience. Backpain and sore hand relief. Dobt forget to enjoy the famius mango sticky rice adter the treatment. Enjoy! 	It was very relaxing and super relief I have received the massage from the staff - I have been a big fan of Let‚Äôs relax spa and have tried many branches and always in love with the style and decoration. I totally recommend this if you‚Äôre looking for a professional massage and spa. 	I recently visited "Lets Relax Spa"], and it was an absolutely rejuvenating experience. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was soothing, with soft lighting, calming music, and a welcoming scent of essential oils.  The staff was incredibly professional and friendly, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout my visit. I opted for a dreaming package which is a combination of foot, hand and head and sholder, and the therapist was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension while still keeping it relaxing.  The facilities were spotless, and every detail‚Äîfrom the cozy treatment rooms to the plush robes‚Äîadded to the luxurious experience. After the session, I was offered a cup of herbal tea with mango which was the perfect way to end such a blissful treatment.  If you're looking for a place to unwind and truly pamper yourself, I highly recommend Lets Relax Spa in Pattaya (opposite Terminal 21). I‚Äôll definitely be returning for another session soon! 	Good experience  everytimes i came here. Recommended to all the one who loves massage~ üíï ‚Ä¶ 	Professional staff. Quick to attend to you. Nice spaces for a relaxing massage. Massage prices are also very competitive and affordable. They have a website to make booking, but has to be 24 hours in advance. but walk-in is easily available. So I would not bother with the website.  Everyone speaks or at least understands English. I had Thai massage, and the masseuse (suratsawadee) was very accommodating. She listened to me about certain areas that I want her to concentrate more on. She is very skilled. Very accommodating. 10/10 experience. 	Very technical masseuse from experienced therapists. Amazing relaxing soothing experience after walking good 10/15 kms. 	Had an amazing experience at Let‚Äôs Relax- the therapists are highly skilled and the facility is clean and very professional and thorough, very foreigner friendly and accessible for people with different languages too as they ask for preferences with tablets. Would highly recommend the Thai massage here! 	While the price is significantly higher than the countless massage shops in Pattaya, you will get a much better experience with a truly professional massage in a relaxed, quiet environment. You should make reservations for this massage. We did a couples massage and it was very enjoyable. Each room has a shower. The session was not rushed. The therapists were professional and attentive. After the massage, we were offered hot tea and mango & sticky rice. It was an excellent experience. If you want a better massage than you can get at most massage shops in town, but don‚Äôt want to pay for the high prices of a 5 star hotel type of spa, this is a good compromise. 	Recommended,staff friendly i will come back . 	Looks better than the cheap places but the quality is similar. The massage lady did the same thing as in most of other Thai massage places. They learn the same thing but have no idea what they're doing. Many of the "technices" have no orthopedical nor comforting feel-good purpose. They are just slightly painful but have absolutely no effect. I still give 3 stars because Thai massage places are often in general just bad compared to in Vietnam or Japan for example 	Really positive experience! Beverage before the massage and then mango sticky rice after! Great Thai massage and very relaxing 	I had 2 hour deep tissue massage and it‚Äôs good. I was able to nap during the massage and it‚Äôs not harsh. It‚Äôs clean and in deed comforting place to have your massage  I asked not to use oil since its scorching hot outside, but I still enjoyed it.  The best part is after the massage care. They let you sit in  the balcony while having your tea and mango sticky rice. 	This was one of the best massage therapy places I have ever went. It was absolutely wonderful and I was sooo relaxed. The masseuse was very careful and now all of my back neck and leg pain is gone! ‚ú®üëå ‚Ä¶ 	5 star massage Very traditional Thai massage Free hot tea and mango sticky rice after massage üòãüëç ‚Ä¶ 	Very good massage and  therapist Profesional. 	The experience is nice very relaxingmassageüëçüëçüëç ‚Ä¶ 	Ambiance and location were great. But reception service is just meh and not friendly. Massage was okay but not the best.

They are very good with it and we had a very relaxing 1 hour foot massage. My girlfriend even fell asleep during the process! It's that great! I could not recommend this place enough and will definitely go again for a full body massage! 	I got a Thai Massage from Kathi.  - excellent technique (never experienced this kind of technique before and i had a lot of Thai Massages) - hard riffs - great pressure - knows exactly how to do  100% visit worth 100% recommendation  I will come back!!! 	The reviews are really good here and when we went it was totally worth it! My other half had 2H oil massage that he claimed relieved all his pressure, while I had 1H body scrub (THB 400) and 1H oil massage (THB 300). We did a lot of massages (more expensive) in Bangkok that weren‚Äôt as good.. 	Had 1hr Thai masaage with Kati for 200thb which was great!!! It felt no difference than what's in the US for insane 100usd! 	This place is full of the ballyhoo of Koreans and Chineses who like using telephones and talking loudly. You cannot really have a good sleepy while having a foot massage here. The skills of the masseur are quite average. 	Have problems with muscles and tendons in my upper back and shoulders so like to get a massage couple of times a week. I often visit Joy Massage for a back and shoulder massage - usually with 'Dao'. She always does a great job and is very polite and professional. 	I really enjoyed my massage at this small shop.  All the staff were very friendly and they provided a really good deep tissue massage. 	Amazing, ask for Na! Legs never felt better. 	Perfect if youre in search of back pain relief. Experienced personal delivering exceptional massages. 	Unbelievable foot massage! Very friendly 	Great foot massage, super friendly staff Super relaxing, I even almost fall asleep first time on foot massage. Definitely one of the best I've ever had in Thailand 	Have been coming here for a few years now. You always know you will get a great massage here. I even bring my young kids here and the ladies give them a great gentle massage also. Great atmosphere and lovely ladies. See you next time. üôèüôè ‚Ä¶ 	Best massage salon in Thailand!! Ask a massage from Daw and say Pikachu sent you & you will see what great massage you get! Prices are very attractive as well! 	One of the best massages I‚Äôve had, I asked for strong massage and she gave it to me. Foot massage in the chair followed by shoulder & back massage upstairs on a foam mat. Clean premises. Will return 	Excellent massage, will definitely visit again. Very friendly and pleasant staff too. 	Great massage!! We had so much fun, and the price is funny. Recommend! 	Pure & professional Thai oil massage will relax your body. It is good

The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home. The customer service was outstanding, and I appreciated how attentive they were to my needs. Although the place is small, it has a cozy and inviting atmosphere. I opted for a two-hour massage, and it was absolutely worth it. I left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated! Highly recommend this gem! 	I was here 2 days in a roll doing 2 hrs Thai oil and the next day foot and oil. Very nice company and the massage is definitely worth the price. Will come back again 	Highly recommend Wipada Massage. It‚Äôs not on the busy tourist roads but is well worth to go and find it. The massage was fabulous and professional. Wipada is safe and friendly. I will definitely come back and recommend you get your next Thai Massage at Wipada. 	I recently visited a delightful massage salon, and I can't say enough good things about my experience! The foot massage was incredibly soothing, relieving all tension and leaving my feet feeling rejuvenated. The Thai massage was equally amazing, combining stretches and pressure techniques that really helped release muscle tension. The atmosphere was calm and inviting, with friendly staff who made me feel welcome throughout my visit. I left feeling relaxed and revitalized! Highly recommend this place for anyone in need of some pampering! 	Went as 3 pax when I visited Thailand recently. One of my companion wasn‚Äôt very satisfied with her massage (too soft).  But it was a great experience for me. The space was cosy, massage was great for me, 1 of them can speak English, the price is very value for money too. Free water after massage as well. 	Found Wipida Massage by googling Sports and Deep Tissue massage. What a superb place. Small shop and unassuming but I was lucky enough to have the owner of the business Wii massage me. I have some muscular issues in my back and left shoulder and Wii gave me probably the best deep tissue (proper ironing!) massage I‚Äôve ever had. What a nice lady too. I am booking a second appointment. I thought the price would be 800 to 1000 bhat because so professional unlike so many massage places with pretty girls who know nothing about either massage or the human anatomy. Wii asked for 500 bhat after 90 mins - so I gave her 800 as that was the min value of this great massage. If anyone is staying in Pattaya and needs a really top notch pro massage this is the place. 5 Stars!! 	Wipada the owner and staff are very friendly. It was a very relaxing massage. After the massage, Wipada recommended me an online taxi which is much cheaper and faster. She is very helpful. 	I‚Äôve visited this massage place in Pattaya twice, with about six months in between, and both times I was very impressed. It‚Äôs honestly one of the best massages I‚Äôve had in Thailand (and I live in Thailand for almost three years now). The therapists are skilled and provide a strong, effective massage that left me feeling relaxed and refreshed. I really enjoyed both experiences and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality massage in Pattaya. 	Incredible massage!! I did the one hour Thai Massage for 250 baht and I feel amazing now! Will definitely come back üòçüòçüòç ‚Ä¶ 	Best massage ever!!! Thank you so much! Great , professional staff! We‚Äôll definitely come back again:) 	Top quality and relaxing massage, better than I expected and will come back! Lovely team of ladies too 	Had a thai massage, the staff were friendly, the prices were good, very good experience overall. Would come back again for sure.	what a fantastic  find this was , a great massage. The ladies were very professional  and friendly. I will return 	Very good massage. Lovely owner. If you want to have massage with a professional massagist, ask for Pami. Helped me very much to get relief from my inflamations. 	Just had foot and a Thai massage best massage since 2005 .Will going back again.Also good price as well üëç ‚Ä¶ 	It's a small shop, but it offers great service. If you only want to get an accurate massage, I recommend it. It's a great and kind place if you just want a massage to relieve your fatigue. 	Excellent message ü§©  Had some back pain that needed a " proper" deep tissue massage .    Was very happy with the massage and could feel my back improve the next day .    thank you to Ms Wee for a very professional massage .

From the moment I entered, I was welcomed so kindly. The service is top notch, the rooms are private and nicely decorated.  And the therapy was so professional,  exactly as strong as my body needed it! I would highly recommend this spa any time and I wish I can come back for another treatment! 	Reception was very friendly and accomodating from start to finish. The ambience is very traditional and warm. The prices are very reasonable for the quality. More importantly I had an incredible massage and facial from Ta. It was the best two hours of my life! I can't recommend Sea Spa enough, just go and find out for yourself! Thanks Sea Spa and Ta, I'll be back! 	Had a Thai massage w/ herb balm  500b & foot massage 400b. It was great experience.  I know I can get cheaper experience but it was relaxing & quiet location. I see several repeat customers coming and going so that is a good sign. I would given 5 stars if credit card are allowed considering its one of bigger spa facility. 	I have been  very good and warm service, the staff are smiling bright and giving good advice, very grateful and highly recommend. 	An unbelievably perfect body scrub followed by 1 hour of deep relaxing massage. I went 2 nights in a row. They are a new business nestled in a quiet area at the end of the road. You won‚Äôt regret Sea Spa. 	The facilities weren‚Äôt that good but the masseur (Jeap) was good she had technique to relieve the back pain ‚Ä¶ recommended if you have back pain 	It's too expensive as compared to the market, it's not value to money. Quality of massage is same to other spa center it's better to go there and price is 3x cheaper. It's look like we just wasted extra money here. 	A excellent Thai massage experience I had, my friend was even fall asleep with relaxation. We had a 3.5 hrs package includes body scrub, Thai massage and oil massage, the massage technicians are very professional and kind. Overall very nice experience!! 	I have over 100 massages in bangkok, jontien, hua hin etc but was treated as a new tourist by Aggressive and pushy staff including a firm demand for a tip once the massage started‚Ä¶below average massage..tons of better options but yes if you are a tourist will probably come once as the location is great, hence the 2 stars 	Good service. Thai massage is excellent. I brought whole family to this place. Everybody was excellent of this. 5 stars	‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êrating for 01) cleanliness 02) Privacy 03) Q of massage, 04) Friendly front desk manager and Therapists 05)Ambience. 500 THB Aroma oil massage each for 3 of us (üë®‚Äçü¶∞, üë©‚Äçü¶∞, and üëß). All 3 of us had a family room üòÑ and happy on the service. It may look Pricy but worthy for experience we had . 5 min drive fromTerminal 21. Shall visit to have Combo offer üôÇ.. Parking üöò at road side infront of spa. A caf√© , itallian restaurant in same campus..Hot ‚òï tea after massage..Refreshing!	I really like this place. It has everything. The food is delicious and the price is not expensive. 	A quiet massage and spa nestled in a Thai decorative setting. This place is an actual massage place that does not offer anything special. The masseur I got for my 90 minute foot. Massage was really good. She knows exactly where to fix my tension and is very friendly. I would recommend booking ahead of time because the place can be quite busy.. The receptionist speaks very good English and is very accommodating to your request. 	It is a splendid spa here. Therapist and receptionist are very kind. Facial massage is  really good.	The service is not good enough, especially the receptionist is arrogant. Better not to go! 	The massages were great. It‚Äôs a bit pricier than other options but worth it for the atmosphere. 	The price so good ! clean , the therapist are polite and friendly üëç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üëçüëçüëç quiet environment,not far from the beach, luxury (Thai) house don't miss !! If you in Pattaya.  If you want a better massage than you can get at most massage shops in town, but don‚Äôt want to pay for the high prices of a 5-6 stars hotel type of spa, this is a good compromise , Highly Recommeded üëçüëçü•∞

So relaxing and fresh.they are so kindly giving good servicesüíï ‚Ä¶ 	Best massage I ever had. Therapist Su was extremely professional and gentle during my 3 hours massage.

Speak very good English üëåüèº Next time in Pattaya definitely I‚Äôll be back. Thank you very much for your excellent service. See you soon! 	Nice and clean spa, great stuff. Just if you not used to thai massage like me, then need to be very clear to be extremely gentle. During massage I felt few times like the lady will break me and was painful, but I have to admit, it felt super easy after massage., all body felt nice. 	This place is the best I have been so far (3 months in Thailand). Real professionals, so clean en beautiful and relaxing. It looks super expensive, but it is not, it is just reasonably priced and worth it all. 	this my second trip in pattaya. every time i stoped in this place. I love it. this trip I stop twice within a week because my back problem  I took combo set first time and aroma massage for the second. thanks to Sky. she knows what she doing. 	Very sweet and polite staff and the spa experience is one of the best ! Would highly recommend to anyone in Pattaya . 	Definitely need visit. It was overbooked and need pre-book in 	We had great experience,  awesome thai style environment with good staff 	The staff was very polite and one of them speak fluent mandarin. I did foot massage and given neck and hand massage at the end for about 10 mins. It was a pleasant experience and the massage was great for a reasonable price. The place is also very clean. 	Very clean facility at a reasonable price , I took 3 hrs in 1 day , So fantastic üòç  Clean , good service and good price  Super High quality Recommend, I wil come back again for sure 100000000% 	Very bad. Missed reservation and more than 30 minutes waiting. I don‚Äôt want to visit this massage anymore 	You can easily book the massage with kind staff is speaking english with call. Massage was good and therapist has good skill of muscle relaxation. You can choose time of massage 60, 90, 120 and price is also resonable. 	Massage was not at all up to the mark. It is like they just rub oil on your body plus the there was no aroma in the oil used. The tea served after the massage was cold. There was no attention to customer satisfaction. By looking at the ambiance you will feel as if the place is good but the quality of massage is really not at par. 	The best massage in Thailand. Very professional, clean place, relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended!!! 	Good spa & good health I recommend ü•∞üëçüèª ‚Ä¶	For me No.1 in Pattaya for spa and Massage.

We both had a 2hr massage for 400 TB each. 1hr Thai massage (with nice clothing that they provide) followed by a 1hr oil massage. I‚Äôve had a lot of deep tissue treatments but my massage from Sao (or Soa) was outstanding. She is a slender lady with grey hair and is very agile and strong. She never gave up on the tightness of my neck and shoulders and relieved most of my tightness. Outstanding massage! Also, I didn‚Äôt believe the prices they advertise but incredible value at Poo Na. Well worth the short walk from the beach area. 	I love this shop. Nong has become one of my favorite therapists.  I just ask for what i want to be focused on, and she'll adjust according to my needs. Will definitely be back. 150 for foot or thai massage.  250 for oil which is similar to Swedish. They do massage your stomach and chest. If not comfortable with that just mention ahead of time and they'll skip it. 	I recently visited Poo Na Health Massage with two friends, and we had an outstanding experience. We opted for a combination of foot massage, head and shoulders massage, and a body scrub, all for a fantastic rate over two hours.  From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was welcoming. The receptionist was friendly and took the time to explain our options, ultimately crafting a custom experience just for us. The masseuse who worked on me was incredibly attentive, focusing on my specific pain points and adjusting pressure as needed. I was impressed that she didn‚Äôt expect an additional tip, which speaks to her professionalism and dedication to providing great service‚Äîthough she certainly deserved one!  The entire session lasted about 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I appreciated the engaging and professional approach of the staff throughout. I left feeling rejuvenated and satisfied with the service. I highly recommend Poo Na Health Massage for anyone seeking an authentic Thai massage experience. I look forward to my next visit! 	Fell in love the first time, Got a Thai massage and had to go back the next day for more! Good pricing and good service, the ladies were welcoming and friendly as well. The place was cozy and left feeling very relaxed. Recommend the Aroma Massage!! 	The Poo Na Health team are seriously the best. I‚Äôve tried both their Thai and foot massages, and both are top-notch. The therapists know exactly how much pressure to apply, and they always leave me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. Plus, the place has a really chill vibe. If you‚Äôre in the area, definitely check them out. 	Came here during my first visit to thailand back in 2022, and now again in 2024. It's really worth the money and super professional.  I had shoulder pain and they applied pain relief oil as well. Would definitely come here again in my next visit! 	Be careful, SCAM!!! I order Head and Shoulder, is more expensive, and they give me normal massage like thai massage which is more cheap. Also i book 1 our, but get only 50 minutes. After massage I claim but anyway they took full money! And after she touched my feed (she did not clean my feet as well), she did not wash her hands, and touched directly my head‚Ä¶this is a no go in Thailand. 	Found this massage parlour based on other reviews. Can't beat the pricing. Ladies are experienced but as some have said, they like to chit chat either with customers or among themselves. Can't fault them cause this is not those fancy spa places either. Still quite a clean place and will get a drink at the end of it. Generally quite a good massage experience. Lady boss friendly as well. 	I tried different locations but this one turned out to be the best I had in Pattaya. We were the group of 4 - the entire family - and all of us absolutely loved it 	Excellent massage with inexpensive price. The masseuses are aged ladies who have professional skill and friendly mind. This shop is small and equipment are worn but I could get great satisfaction from the nice massage they gave me. I'd visit this massage shop everyday when I was staying in Pattaya. I miss them a lot and want to go Pattaya again to get their fantastic massage. Thank you for every staff in this shop as well as Kit and Nut.	price had risen at 150 the/1 hour Prefer book on line app 	Natalie was amazing! Came two days in a row! No funny business here, great massage quality and was able to customize for my needs. Small shop, everyone is friendly and personable. 	The service is amazing (thai and oil massage), sri really knows what she‚Äôs doing and focus on the areas which it hurts the most,, I stayed in Pattaya for 3 days and went to poo na everyday. Highly recommended. 	Amazing! I had so much pain and tightness to my back, hips and legs. The lady knew exactly how and where to apply pressure. I left with an increased range of motion and relaxed. I think I paid 150b for an hour. No tip was asked, but she definitely deserved it. I highly recommend! 	It‚Äôs a great place to take experience of traditional Thai massage. We took body scrub and it was great. 	Best massage place in Pattaya. Everyone in Poo na is really friendly and treated me so well. Loved it 	Gave me the roughest thai massage ever, this lady did not know how to give a Thai massage came out there aching and pain

Right new to Central Festival Mall.  Easy access for everyone.  2. The entrance was clean and swept.  The workers were not seating outside and hassling anyone for business.  No one was being pushy‚Ä¶.just the opposite- everyone was well mannered and very polite.  3. I did not feel a ‚Äòyuk‚Äô vibe.  This place is PRO‚Ä¶it is not sleezy.  The whole experience(my wife went with me)‚Ä¶was very good.  4. Working uniforms were very clean and modest.  5. The leather recliners were new and clean and comfortable.  6. Nice smell to the whole place‚Ä¶a nice aroma filling the large main area.  7. Relaxing music‚Ä¶music that makes you go to sleep in a good way.  8. Pro massage not a painful massage.  9. 200 baht is a super great price!  Awesome for the quality.  Tip your person when you are done, they deserve it.  If you want a great experience, ‚Äòcheap‚Äô, good location, not sleazy‚Ä¶this is your place‚Ä¶.you‚Äôll leave a happy person.  Peace. 	Shop closes at 11pm instead of midnight now. Below average foot massage, not much strength and not as good as compared to the other options down the street. Standard 200 baht for 1 hour. Spacious outlet. 	I went here with my wife (she also gives massage herself), the shop looked nice and clean, ladies were polite.  Upon entering you immediately get slippers and your feet are washed.  then you go to your place, my wife got thai massage and i got foot massage and manicure.  I finally had someone who gave good firm massage and not just rubbing feet and legs, wonderful!!!  After my wife was done she had the same experience as what I had, good and firm massage.  The prices are normal for pattaya, but here you get more for your money, and of course don't forget to give the ladies a good tip... 	This place is great. There is often a small wait, but it is well worth it. The staff are friendly and professional. Their facility is clean and equipment is in good working order. If you need a good foot massage at a reasonable price, look no further. (I did not experience the full Thai massage and can not speak to that) 	this place rocks. unbelivable prices for the work that is placed to ensure I get a great foot massage.  they should charge $100us for the amount of work n effort here.  love this place and awesome staff!!!! 	There are 2 shops sharing the same name side by side, with different entrances. There was no pressure by masseuses from either side. I went in from the right shop and I was pleasantly surprised by their professionalism. I had a back and shoulder rub and it was invigorating to say the least. It was relaxing and the pressure was just right. No extreme pain. Every move was a good rub and fell comfortable. Extremely satisfied! Only 300 baht for an hour üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª 	Good location. Worth the price for 90-min foot massage package at 400 baht only. The staff with good attitude and technique. Contrarily, the staff at another branch inside Central Pattaya were with extremely bad attitude and no one response while I was asking at the reception. 	Had an one hour thai massage. Was quite strong compared to others i had in thailand. But it was great and just right. Rooms are modern and in great shape. Staff where friendly and i had a great overall experience here. 	Woman massaging was using her phone messaging throughout my massage. Didn‚Äôt stop talking either. With so much competition you‚Äôd think they would be professional. I will not be returning 	Nice massage therapy shop Highly recommend Masseur Ms.Mimii Special Package 90min Foot massage Head Shoulder	A nice and safe place! They have a variety of offerings. Masseuse welcomed me and did not rush me throughout the process. She kept checking if I was doing okay and if the pressure is enough for me. Had taken oil massage and was quite satisfied with it. I think it's a norm to tip these days.. so go ahead and don't shy away! Would visit again 	This is a genuine massage place. I go here for body and shoulder and foot massage. The minimum price is 200 baht but if you go for a package deal you get a discount like we did. Do not embarrass yourself by asking for extra services.  The masseuse are highly trained and experienced for conducting body and foot treatment.  Highly recommend this place. The staff is very friendly. 	Their therapies are slightly costly than similar parlours, but completely worth it.  We took foot therapy and turned out to be very nice.  We tried couple of other parlours aswell and this was the most hygienic and the therapy was good aswell.  Only downturn:  the massage ended 5 mins prior and further, the therapists asked for tip over and above the massage which anyway was slightly costlier 	The best massage parlor in Pattaya. Experienced masseurs and good ambiance. True story. They returned a pair of sunglasses that I had forgotten after a month of loosing them. Very honest. 	For me best  massage  saloon Pattaya. Staf helpful.clean and good massage .Thanks üëç ‚Ä¶ 	Terrible massage and a therapist was using her phone through the session. I will not return to this place. 	One of the best. Large, clean facility with good size individual massage rooms, at least for oil massage. Very nice girls/women give very good straight oil massage, 300B.
