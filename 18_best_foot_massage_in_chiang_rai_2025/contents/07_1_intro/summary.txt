Chamonpond Massage
・Rating: 4.4
・Price: Budget-friendly
・Recommended: Those who care more about a skillful, strong massage than fancy surroundings.
・Run by a local Akha family, Chamonpond offers what sounds like a genuinely authentic and <strong><u>highly skilled massage</u></strong> experience. People rave about how good, strong, and firm the massages are, particularly the foot massages – some even call them the best they've had in Thailand! The staff are described as friendly and intuitive, really knowing how to work on problem areas. While the place itself might look a bit simple or unassuming, the <strong><u>quality of the massage</u></strong> itself gets top marks. It's a fantastic option if your priority is getting a truly effective, powerful treatment from a local family business at a <strong><u>great cheap price</u></strong>, rather than a spa-like atmosphere.
