・This spot gets high marks for delivering <strong><u>phenomenal and thorough massages</u></strong>, especially Thai and foot styles, at a price that's hard to beat. People mention feeling genuinely rejuvenated afterwards, noting that the masseuses are really attentive to sore spots and provide a professional treatment overall. It seems like you get <strong><u>excellent value</u></strong> here if you're focused purely on the quality of the massage itself.
