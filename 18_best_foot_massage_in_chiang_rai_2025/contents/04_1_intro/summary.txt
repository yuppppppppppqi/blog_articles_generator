・Wow, Kham Paeng gets some seriously glowing reviews, often described as offering one of the <strong><u>best Thai massages people have ever had</u></strong>, especially considering the incredibly low price! It sounds like you get way more than you pay for here. Masseuses are noted for having really good pressure, skillfully finding those tight spots and working on them effectively. People seem to leave feeling incredibly relaxed, mentioning an almost spa-like vibe despite the budget cost. There was a little confusion mentioned by one person about possibly paying extra for harder pressure, but overall, the <strong><u>value for money</u></strong> seems absolutely outstanding. It's a top pick if you want an <strong><u>amazing, relaxing massage</u></strong> without spending much.
