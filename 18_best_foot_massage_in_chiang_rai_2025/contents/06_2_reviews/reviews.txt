A <strong><u>phenomenal 90-minute Thai massage</u></strong>! Very affordable and definitely worth wandering in for. Highly recommend.
<strong><u>Best massage</u></strong> I got in Thailand! So thorough and absolutely <strong><u>perfect</u></strong>. Left feeling amazing.
<strong><u>Incredible massage</u></strong>! The lady had firm pressure and covered all parts. Left feeling <strong><u>very satisfied</u></strong>.
Very <strong><u>professional massage</u></strong>, attentive to sore spots. Felt comfortable, relaxed, and <strong><u>completely rejuvenated</u></strong>!
Had an <strong><u>amazing footmassage</u></strong>, and my daughters loved their full body oil massage. Professional and good atmosphere.
<strong><u>Highly recommended</u></strong> place for a quality massage experience in Chiang Rai. Professional and effective.
<strong><u>Great massage</u></strong> experience! Felt relaxed and refreshed afterwards. Will definitely come back next time.
Very cheap, very serious massage. Definitely <strong><u>worth recommending</u></strong>, a solid 5-star experience for the price.
Staff seemed unprofessional, heard some body-shaming comments which made it difficult to fully enjoy the massage.
The massage experience felt unprofessional and rude at times, which unfortunately ruined the relaxation aspect.
