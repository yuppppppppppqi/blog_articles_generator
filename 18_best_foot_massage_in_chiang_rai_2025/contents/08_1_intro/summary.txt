・Rating: 4.9
・Price: Mid-range to Premium
・Recommended: Anyone wanting a true spa pampering session with excellent service and customization.
・Grand Spa sounds like it delivers a <strong><u>truly exceptional spa experience</u></strong> from the moment you walk in. Everything points towards top-notch service: polite and professional staff, a peaceful and clean atmosphere, and lovely touches like complimentary tea. People praise the massages (Thai, foot, aroma oil) as being both relaxing and effective. A big plus seems to be the ability to <strong><u>customize your treatment</u></strong>, choosing specific oils or areas to focus on. It's positioned as a more premium option, maybe slightly pricier than basic shops, but perfect if you're looking to treat yourself or a partner to a <strong><u>luxurious and pampering</u></strong> massage session with great attention to detail.
