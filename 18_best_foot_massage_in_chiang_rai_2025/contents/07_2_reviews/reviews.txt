<strong><u>Exceptional massage experience</u></strong>! While they could add foot wash/face cradle, the <strong><u>service shines</u></strong> brightly.
Had a <strong><u>great massage</u></strong> here from the man. Asked for medium pressure, and he was <strong><u>spot on</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Absolutely amazing massage</u></strong>! Probably the <strong><u>best foot massage</u></strong> I had in Thailand. Super nice staff!
The <strong><u>best massage</u></strong> I had in Thailand! <strong><u>Li was amazing</u></strong>, skillful and attentive. Highly recommended!
<strong><u>Great & cheap massage</u></strong>, covered everything from feet to top. Felt refreshed, got 5 mins extra too!
WOW. <strong><u>Best massage ever</u></strong>, truly. This woman knows what she's doing, <strong><u>it was amazing</u></strong>.
Excellent massage, strong, firm, with conviction. <strong><u>Highly recommend Moon</u></strong>, she is fantastic! Will return.
Loved the hour-long foot massage experience here, honestly the <strong><u>best I've ever had</u></strong>. So relaxing.
The massage was great, but the place is unassuming; wish the interior matched the quality.
Good massage, though slightly distracted by loud customers talking halfway through the session.
