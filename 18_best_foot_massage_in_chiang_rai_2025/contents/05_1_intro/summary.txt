Chiangrai massage
・Rating: 4.8
・Price: Budget-friendly (around 200 THB/hour)
・Recommended: Those who love a strong, deep massage and want great value.
・If you're someone who really likes a massage with serious power, Chiangrai Massage sounds like the place to go. It's frequently praised for its <strong><u>strong, deep, and thorough</u></strong> Thai and sports massages. The therapists seem skilled at listening to what you need and are effective at really getting into tight muscles – perfect if you've got knots you want worked out! It's noted as being clean and the price is incredibly reasonable, offering <strong><u>fantastic value</u></strong>. Be prepared for potentially intense pressure, though; this isn't the spot for a light, gentle rub. While most reviews are great, a couple mentioned less positive experiences, but overall it seems a <strong><u>top choice for a powerful massage</u></strong>.
