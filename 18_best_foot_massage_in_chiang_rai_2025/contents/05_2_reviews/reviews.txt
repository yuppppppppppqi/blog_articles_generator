<strong><u>Excellent Thai massage</u></strong> at reasonable prices. Clean room, fresh smell. Highly recommended!
<strong><u>Very good massage</u></strong>! Therapists were <strong><u>very strong and skilled</u></strong>, took their time working on knots.
<strong><u>Best massage</u></strong> I've had! The masseuse is <strong><u>STRONG</u></strong>, great for a deep, thorough massage.
Super friendly staff, <strong><u>reasonably priced</u></strong>, and most importantly, <strong><u>great Thai massages</u></strong>. Will return.
<strong><u>Fantastic experience</u></strong> for both feet and body massage. Attentive to requests and adjusted style perfectly.
Best massage ever! A bit painful but in the <strong><u>best way possible</u></strong>, really worked tight muscles.
<strong><u>Fantastic massage</u></strong>! Very friendly and professional therapists. Happy with both foot and Thai massage.
<strong><u>Very good Thai massage</u></strong>, not generic. Accepted request for stronger pressure without overdoing it.
The massage was okay, but the bed wasn't the cleanest and the therapist seemed distracted by phone.
Chose sports oil massage, but felt more like just rubbing oil, not a deep massage specialist.
