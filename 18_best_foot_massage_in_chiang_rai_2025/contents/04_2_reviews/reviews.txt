Omg, <strong><u>amazing Thai massage</u></strong>! If I lived here, I'd come weekly. So good and <strong><u>cheap</u></strong>!
<strong><u>Fantastic experience</u></strong> with the oil massage, good pressure, very relaxing, I even fell asleep!
Such a <strong><u>refreshing massage</u></strong>! Thank you for the friendly service, will definitely visit again soon.
Found this place randomly and was <strong><u>very impressed</u></strong>. Felt like a spa massage, <strong><u>highly recommended</u></strong>.
Very good, the lady <strong><u>found the hotspots</u></strong> and focused on fixing them. Felt much better after.
Had <strong><u>two excellent massages</u></strong> here with my wife. Extremely happy with the <strong><u>quality of service</u></strong>.
Came during Songkran, it was my <strong><u>best experience ever</u></strong>! Highly recommend this Thai massage place.
By far one of the <strong><u>BEST massages</u></strong> in Thailand! Very impressed and such a <strong><u>reasonable price</u></strong>.
The massage itself was okay, but the therapist talked quite a bit, making it less peaceful.
Heard about different prices for pressure levels, which felt a bit confusing and slightly off-putting.
