<strong><u>Amazing foot massage</u></strong>! Loved the quiet place, <strong><u>good price</u></strong>, and complimentary tea. Felt so refreshed.
It was an <strong><u>incredible experience</u></strong>. Best full body massage ever, left feeling <strong><u>like new</u></strong>! Highly recommend.
Lovely massage here, <strong><u>very firm</u></strong> but just what I needed. Relaxing atmosphere and polite staff.
The <strong><u>best foot massage ever</u></strong>! Very nice staff, even gave a <strong><u>free shoulder massage</u></strong>. Amazing value.
Such <strong><u>nice massages</u></strong> here, felt so good afterwards. Definitely the <strong><u>best place</u></strong> to get a massage.
<strong><u>Fantastic authentic experience</u></strong>! Highly recommended for a genuine Thai massage. Thank you Cho Kaew!
One of the <strong><u>best massages</u></strong> in Thailand so far! It was strong and incredibly <strong><u>relaxing</u></strong>.
Very <strong><u>good massage</u></strong>, felt like all muscle groups were thoroughly worked. Felt great afterwards!
The massage was quite firm, maybe a bit too strong for my personal preference but still okay.
It was a decent massage, although the room could have been a bit quieter for full relaxation.
