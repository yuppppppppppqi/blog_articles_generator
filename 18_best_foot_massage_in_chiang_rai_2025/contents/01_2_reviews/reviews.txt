My feet feel like clouds after the <strong><u>1 hr foot massage</u></strong>! Absolutely the <strong><u>best</u></strong> I've had in Thailand.
Such a <strong><u>nice place for relaxing</u></strong> after a tired day. Very <strong><u>good service</u></strong> from owner and massagers.
<strong><u>Head, neck & shoulder massage was solid</u></strong>. Highly recommended, you can <strong><u>feel the power</u></strong>!
Had a great experience here. <strong><u>Staff were friendly and welcoming</u></strong> at the new night market location.
The <strong><u>masseuse was great</u></strong>, really skilled. Just wish it had been the full hour promised.
My <strong><u>feet feel amazing</u></strong> after the massage here. Definitely one of the better ones I've tried.
<strong><u>Excellent Thai Massage</u></strong> in Chiangrai! Great location and <strong><u>very good service</u></strong> provided.
Found the massage quite relaxing. The <strong><u>value for money</u></strong> at 250b was decent for the area.
Massage felt rushed and technique seemed basic, unfortunately not the best experience I've had here.
Time seemed shorter than advertised, started counting before we even got inside which was slightly disappointing.
