Truly enjoyed the <strong><u>ambience & serenity</u></strong>. One of the best massages, <strong><u>just right</u></strong>, not too violent.
This massage shop is <strong><u>amazing</u></strong>! <strong><u>Outstanding experience</u></strong> from start to finish. Very professional.
The <strong><u>best massage & body scrub</u></strong> I've ever experienced! Absolutely <strong><u>5 stars</u></strong>, felt incredible afterwards.
<strong><u>Amazing oil massage</u></strong>, the lady knew what she was doing. For 400 baht, <strong><u>really great value</u></strong>.
Hands down the <strong><u>best Thai massage</u></strong> I've ever had. Good professionals, <strong><u>highly recommended</u></strong> for sure.
Had oil and neck massage, it was a <strong><u>great experience</u></strong>. Highly recommend visiting in Chiang Rai!
Therapist <strong><u>Nan</u></strong> was caring and professional, using expertise for my back injury. <strong><u>Highly recommend</u></strong>!
Loved the <strong><u>feet, neck, shoulders, and face massage</u></strong>! Cosy place, <strong><u>well-experienced and friendly</u></strong> lady.
The pressure was good, but the room felt a little less private than I expected.
It was a solid massage, though maybe lacked a bit of the deep relaxation I hoped for.
