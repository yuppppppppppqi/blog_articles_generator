舞ecommended: Visitors seeking a convenient, affordable massage near the night market, accepting some variability.
臺kay, so Naraya is super handy with its spot right by the night market, making it easy to pop in after shopping. It's definitely <strong><u>easy on the wallet</u></strong>, which is a big plus. The experiences here seem to be a bit of a mixed bag, though. Some people rave about getting an absolutely <strong><u>fantastic foot or neck massage</u></strong>, feeling totally relaxed afterwards. Others mentioned the massage felt a bit rushed or wasn't quite what they expected in terms of consistency. The staff are usually friendly, and it's helpful that they can manage some English and Chinese. It's a decent option if location and price are your top priorities, just know the <strong><u>quality can vary</u></strong> sometimes.
