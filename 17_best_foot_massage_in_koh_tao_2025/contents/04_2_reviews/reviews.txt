<strong><u>Excellent massage</u></strong>! <strong><u><strong><u>Bee</u></strong></u></strong> handled my back injury with great professionalism, skill, and care. Felt huge relief.
Had two amazing massages here by <strong><u><strong><u>Tsip</u></strong></u></strong>! She really paid attention to my sore spots. Very friendly!
Great Thai + oil massage. <strong><u>Very professional</u></strong> with top-notch technique, and they serve lovely tea afterwards.
Truly the <strong><u>best massage on Koh Tao</u></strong>! Came back for a second one, left super relaxed.
This was the <strong><u>absolute best massage</u></strong> I've ever gotten! The ladies knew every pressure point perfectly.
Wow, just wow. Among the <strong><u>best Thai massages</u></strong>. Pressure was perfect, strong but soft. Loved the jazz!
They really helped my pulled muscle. Felt 80% better after their <strong><u>thorough treatment</u></strong>. Highly recommend!
Such lovely staff and a friendly owner, <strong><u><strong><u>Moo</u></strong></u></strong>. The place is great - air-conditioned and clean too!
Really good massage, but the location means you can sometimes hear a bit of traffic noise.
The jazz music was nice, but maybe offering a choice of background sound would be even better.
