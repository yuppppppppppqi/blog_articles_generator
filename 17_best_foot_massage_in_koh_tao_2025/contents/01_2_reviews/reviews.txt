Absolutely <strong><u>amazing experience</u></strong>! The atmosphere was so tranquil, and the essential oils smelled wonderful.
<strong><u>Excellent Thai Massage</u></strong>. We went as a couple for the oil massage and absolutely loved it!
A <strong><u>perfect massage</u></strong> in a very good place. The oils they used smelled fantastic.
Felt so much taller after the stretching! The little masseuse found all my <strong><u>blocked energy points</u></strong>.
Truly the <strong><u>best massage</u></strong> I've had in Thailand. My therapist thoroughly worked out all problem areas.
These are the best massages in Koh Tao. The ladies are <strong><u>very professional</u></strong> and tailor the pressure.
Highly recommend the therapist <strong><u><strong><u>One</u></strong></u></strong>! She fixed the issues I was having; felt much better after.
One of the <strong><u>best massages of my life</u></strong>! The staff are gifted and it's great <strong><u>value for money</u></strong>.
The environment was nice and peaceful, but personally, I found the room a bit too cold.
It wasn't for me; felt like they just smeared oil without much pressure on specific spots.
