Pure relaxation with the sound of the waves. The <strong><u>skilled therapists</u></strong> made it unforgettable.
Felt amazing after the Thai massage, especially since I was sore from training. <strong><u>Highly recommend</u></strong>!
They do <strong><u>amazing foot massages</u></strong> here! Also tried the oil massage with <strong><u><strong><u>Aon</u></strong></u></strong>, she was excellent.
The <strong><u>best massages</u></strong> we've had in Thailand! The ointment they used felt so good.
Having a foot massage right in front of the beach was lovely. My friend said <strong><u>full body was incredible</u></strong>.
Our aromatherapy massage was incredible, truly the <strong><u>best we've ever had</u></strong> for only 300 THB!
Getting my nails done hearing the waves was magical. Such a <strong><u>peaceful beachside setting</u></strong>.
My partner loved the foot massage, and my Thai massage was fantastic. <strong><u>Such a pleasant experience</u></strong> overall.
My foot massage barely touched my feet, mostly legs with no pressure. Disappointing experience for me.
It was quite noisy and lacked privacy for an oil massage. Wouldn't really recommend it.
