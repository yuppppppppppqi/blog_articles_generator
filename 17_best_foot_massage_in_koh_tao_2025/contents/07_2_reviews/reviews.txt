Had the <strong><u>best massage of our trip</u></strong> here. Great service and very relaxing atmosphere right by beach.
The <strong><u>best foot massage</u></strong> I had was with <strong><u><strong><u>Spi</u></strong></u></strong>! So thorough, included reflexology and even neck rub.
Lovely quiet place directly at the beach. The women are super friendly, <strong><u>totally recommend Kayo</u></strong>!
One of the <strong><u>best massages we've had in Thailand</u></strong>, maybe even SE Asia! And super reasonably priced.
Found my spot! After trying others, this place is the best - <strong><u>professional, clean, kind, and cheap</u></strong>.
Classic 300 baht massage with <strong><u>excellent service</u></strong>. Plus, the foot massage gets a sea view!
Got my nails done here overlooking the sea, so relaxing. She <strong><u>really sorted them out</u></strong> perfectly.
Best massage I've had in Thailand. The staff here are <strong><u>true professionals</u></strong>, highly skilled people.
The massage area is one big room without curtains, which might feel lacking in privacy for some.
My oil massage felt more like gentle stroking; lacked the focus and technique I was hoping for.
