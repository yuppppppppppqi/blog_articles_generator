Absolutely <strong><u>wonderful massage</u></strong> and very sweet staff. We came back three times during our stay!
The Aloe Vera massage was definitely the <strong><u>best I've ever had</u></strong>, really helped my back.
After a month travelling, these were the best massages. Very polite staff and <strong><u>lovely tea afterwards</u></strong>.
Got an <strong><u>excellent foot massage</u></strong> here. The masseuse was kind and applied the perfect pressure.
Had a pinched muscle and they did an <strong><u>amazing job fixing it</u></strong>! Very professional and clean place.
The Thai massage by <strong><u><strong><u>Moany</u></strong> (?) was heavenly</u></strong>, beyond skilled, felt like physio and massage combined.
The head massage with <strong><u><strong><u>Naam</u></strong> was amazing</u></strong>, pure gold in her hands. Best in Thailand!
This is the <strong><u>best massage in Koh Tao</u></strong>! Very professional staff, we come back every year.
Service felt unprofessional; they told us to return later but didn't keep our spot.
Good massage, but be prepared for potential waiting times as it's quite popular here.
