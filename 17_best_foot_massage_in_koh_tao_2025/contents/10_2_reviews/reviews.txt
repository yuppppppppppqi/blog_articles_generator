<strong><u>Beautiful beachside location</u></strong>! The large Thai wooden house gives a real sense of authenticity. Loved the vibe.
The moo kata and steamed squid were <strong><u>absolutely delicious</u></strong>! Nothing to complain about the food here.
Nice place to chill out day or evening. Had a <strong><u>very good banana dessert</u></strong> here.
Great restaurant right on the front with <strong><u>stunning views</u></strong>. The Panang Curry was fantastic too.
A <strong><u>beautiful spot</u></strong> to watch the sunset with reasonably priced beers right on the beach.
The BBQ shrimp and white snapper were <strong><u>gorgeous</u></strong>! We really liked the spicy seafood sauce too.
Staff were <strong><u>absolutely nice and friendly</u></strong>. Made the experience even better. Would recommend this restaurant.
The <strong><u>atmosphere and sunset views</u></strong> are great, lovely chairs to relax in right by the sea.
Food wasn't great; arrived lukewarm and ingredients seemed basic, maybe like from 7/11 nearby.
The service was quite bad; had to wait ages and the waiter wasn't happy about requests.
