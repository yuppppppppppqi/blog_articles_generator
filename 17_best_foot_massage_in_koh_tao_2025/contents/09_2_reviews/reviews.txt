<strong><u>Excellent Thai massage</u></strong>. The therapist was gentle and very attentive to my requests. Highly recommend it!
As a trained therapist, I can say this is the <strong><u>best spa</u></strong> I've been to in Thailand.
My <strong><u>favorite sanctuary</u></strong> on Koh Tao. Love the aroma oil massages in the clean, nicely lit rooms.
Had an <strong><u>amazing shoulder & head massage</u></strong> here. Didn't want to leave! Clean, quiet, and relaxing.
The <strong><u>best massage I had in a while</u></strong>! The salon is clean, relaxed, with experienced ladies.
Got a great foot massage and a back massage that <strong><u>pushed out all my desk job knots</u></strong>!
Really the <strong><u>BEST massage spa</u></strong> on the island. They go the extra mile with service details.
Very good service from the start, including a form for pressure preference. <strong><u>Oil massage was great</u></strong>.
Fantastic massage, but it's a bit pricier compared to some other places on the island.
Because it's so good, it can get busy; booking ahead might be a good idea.
