One of the <strong><u>BEST massage places</u></strong> we've ever found in Thailand! Truly professional and kind staff.
Definitely the <strong><u>best Thai massage</u></strong> I've ever had. All the ladies are so good and professional!
These are the <strong><u>best massages I ever had</u></strong>. They have magical hands and really fixed my aches.
My Thai oil massage was outstanding compared to others on the island. A <strong><u>very enjoyable experience</u></strong>.
The <strong><u>best Thai Massage ever</u></strong>! Comfy beds, kind women, professional, and hit just the right sore spots.
Received <strong><u>great back & shoulder massages</u></strong> here. The therapists really knew what they were doing. Felt flexible!
Such a <strong><u>great experience</u></strong>! The aloe vera full body massage was amazing and not rushed at all.
The <strong><u>best massage I had in Thailand</u></strong>! And such incredible <strong><u>value for money</u></strong> too. Highly recommend.
The foot scrub service was poor; only lasted 15 minutes and barely any scrubbing involved.
While massages are great, sometimes there's only one person working, which can affect service availability.
