Still the <strong><u>best massage on the island</u></strong> after coming back for years. A must-visit after diving!
Such a <strong><u>fantastic massage place</u></strong>! The ladies were lovely and accommodating, went two nights in a row.
It was my first massage ever, and it was a <strong><u>really good experience</u></strong>. The relief was worth it!
Very good massage for a <strong><u>good price</u></strong>. The people were extremely friendly and helpful too.
Getting a massage right on the beach listening to the waves? <strong><u>Can't get better than this</u></strong>!
Loved the massage with the sound of the waves and the breeze. Go morning for fewer people!
Been here twice and both times were <strong><u>exceptional</u></strong>. Very professional, clean equipment, and knowledgeable staff.
A great spot for a <strong><u>very good massage</u></strong>. The chill atmosphere with the waves is wonderful.
Authentic experience, but don't expect peak hygiene or privacy. It's quite no-frills.
My masseuse kept talking and stopping the massage. Couldn't relax, and the massage wasn't great either.
