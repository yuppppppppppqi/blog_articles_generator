<strong><u>Absolutely excellent massage</u></strong> and service in a super relaxed environment. The ladies were lovely and attentive.
A <strong><u>really good foot massage</u></strong>, would definitely recommend this place. Plus, free tea afterwards!
Thank you <strong><u><strong><u>Nam</u></strong></u></strong>! The Aloe Vera massage is the <strong><u>best we ever had</u></strong>, such a wonderful time.
Amazing massage with <strong><u>attentive service</u></strong>. The Thai Oil massage had a great level of pressure.
Found this gem and returned 3 more times! The ladies here are <strong><u>particularly skilful</u></strong>.
Got an amazing massage from <strong><u><strong><u>Mai</u></strong></u></strong>. She is actually strong and can fix any sore areas.
One of the <strong><u>best and most pleasant massages</u></strong> I ever had was the Lavender Aroma with <strong><u><strong><u>Dada</u></strong></u></strong>!
Had a <strong><u>wonderful, relaxing massage</u></strong>. The masseuse was very knowledgeable and suggested the perfect type for me.
My experience wasn't great; the masseuse seemed unprofessional and kept using her phone during the session.
It's a nice salon, but the massage quality seemed to vary depending on which therapist you get.
