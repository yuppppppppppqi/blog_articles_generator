And I had a lot of massages regarding my back problems within the last 15 years. ‚Ä¶	After a month of travelling and trying different places. I found myself having the best massages at Kinnaree. Staff very polite and always have tea ready after you finish your massage	I got an excellent foot (and leg) massage on a rainy day. The masseuse was very kind and friendly. She applied the perfect amount of pressure. The premises are calm  inviting and clean. This was my second time there.	I had a pinched muscle in my upper spine with very limited head mobility and she did an amazing job!! She basically fixed me. Very professional  cozy  clean and calm environment. Would 100% recommend.	I definitely just had the most insane Thai massage ever in life. By insane I mean heavenly. Moany (apologies if spelled wrong ) was beyond skilled and felt like my physical therapist and massage therapist had the best baby in the world. ‚Ä¶	I had head massage with Naam  she has pure gold in the hands  it was amazing (and I consider myself difficult to satisfy) Best massage in Tha√Ølande for sure (it was my 4th) Thank you ü•∞ ‚Ä¶	This is the best massage in Koh Tao! Very professional staff! We come to Koh Tao every year specially for a course of this massage. We love You! Thank You so much and see You next year!	The best massage that I had in Ko Tao  professional  fair price  parking place  sometimes there is a waiting time to get in.	ChIJo679rW2hVTARmDnaUjlUwcs

So I decided for a massage on the beach! ‚Ä¶	A massage with the sound of the waves and the breeze. Can't get better than this! I suggest going in the morning when there are less people on the beach.	I dont recommend it! I went based on the reviews  but my experience was bad. The masseuse kept talking with others and stopped the massage all the time! I couldn‚Äôt relax for a single minute. Additionally  the massage itself was not good	I‚Äôve been here twice now and both times have been exceptional.  Very professional  clean equipment and knowledgable. ‚Ä¶	ChIJ9wqTFeyhVTARQhnqCE1BgaI
