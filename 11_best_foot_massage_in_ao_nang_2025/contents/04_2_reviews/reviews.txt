<strong><u>Natalie and Fai gave professional massages</u></strong>, focusing on our specific back and foot pain.
<strong><u>Best massage in town! Great service and lovely staff.</u></strong> Katie was the best ever!
Wow! The <strong><u>most amazing, unforgettable massage of our vacation!</u></strong> So professional and welcoming.
<strong><u>Natalie's aloe vera massage was fantastic for my sunburn.</u></strong> Very clean salon too.
The <strong><u>symptomatic massage fixed my long-standing injuries!</u></strong> Felt fantastic afterwards. Highly recommend.
<strong><u>Loved the professional massage from the amazing therapist.</u></strong> A must-try in Krabi!
Cozy atmosphere, <strong><u>gentle yet precise therapists</u></strong>. Reasonable price, definitely coming back!
<strong><u>Natalie gave a fantastic Thai oil massage.</u></strong> Came out feeling like a new woman!
Service quality felt poor and inconsistent, especially compared to other places nearby.
Felt like a rip-off, therapist lacked training and just went through motions.
