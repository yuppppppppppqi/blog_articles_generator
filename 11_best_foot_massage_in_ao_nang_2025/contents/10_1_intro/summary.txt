Ally Massage 3
・Rating: 4.3
・Price: Affordable
・Recommended: Budget-conscious visitors looking for friendly service and foot care, but okay with a busy vibe and varying quality.
This place definitely buzzes with energy! The staff are super friendly and welcoming right from the door, making you feel instantly comfortable. They offer a good range of services, including foot scrubs and pedicures, which is a nice bonus. I've heard specific therapists like <strong><u>Kom</u></strong> and <strong><u>Aoun</u></strong> get great praise for their skills. It's a very popular spot, so don't expect a quiet, tranquil experience – it's more lively. While many people rave about the <strong><u>great value</u></strong> and friendly atmosphere, some have mentioned that the massage quality can be inconsistent, sometimes feeling rushed or lacking pressure. There have also been rare mentions of being short-changed on time or even unprofessional behaviour, so it's a bit of a gamble, but potentially rewarding for the price.
