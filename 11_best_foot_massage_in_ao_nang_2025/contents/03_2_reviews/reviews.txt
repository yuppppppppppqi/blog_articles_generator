<strong><u>Loved this place!</u></strong> Massage was 10/10, super professional and sweet staff. Very clean!
<strong><u>Kenny gave a fantastic head/foot massage.</u></strong> Lovely spot, inexpensive, would definitely return.
<strong><u>Jenny cracked my back so well!</u></strong> One of the best massages I've had in Thailand.
Super clean with a <strong><u>peaceful atmosphere</u></strong>. Professional massage and great value for money.
Absolutely <strong><u>wonderful traditional Thai massage</u></strong>. Staff were friendly and very professional. Highly recommend!
Amazing Thai massage! <strong><u>Gentle but hard when needed.</u></strong> So relaxing inside, treated amazingly.
<strong><u>Beautiful, relaxing experience.</u></strong> Had Thai massage one day, head/neck/foot the next. Recommended!
<strong><u>Minuses gave a wonderful massage.</u></strong> Friendly, welcoming staff. Would recommend her to anyone.
Foot massage chair didn't recline, making it hard to fully relax during the treatment.
The gel polish manicure started peeling off after only three days, which was disappointing.
