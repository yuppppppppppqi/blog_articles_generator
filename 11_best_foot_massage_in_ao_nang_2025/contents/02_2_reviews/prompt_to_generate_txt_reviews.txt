We got the after sun massage (60 min) with hemp seed oil (cannabis sativa).  Overall a lovely experience which I would recommend! 	In lazy dayz you can find everything you need to enjoy the evening. Nice selection of weed,  good quality clothes and thai massage. The owner is a nice guy who even ordered my size and sent it to me by mail to Koh Phangan. I'm sure you'll feel good here. 	Good massage. The person who guided us was well versed in English and helpful. 	Lovely staff, very clean salon and great pressure. Amazing value for money! I would definitely recommend! 	2 stars because I feel horrible for the lady that massaged me. When I walked in she went straight from massaging one lady, straight to me without washing her hands which grossed me out so bad but she was so sweet I didn‚Äôt want to say anything. The reception guy is also very sweet which is why I‚Äôm giving 2 stars.  I got a 1hr foot massage and about 10 minutes was actually spent on my feet. The rest was her just rubbing my shins. I‚Äôve been getting massages across Thailand for 10+ years so I know not to expect the best, but this was bad.  After my massage was finished she went straight from me to another woman again without washing her hands ü•¥  I also felt bad cause it was 3 people back to back basically without her getting even a minute break between. 	The massage is not professional. It‚Äôs like paying others to touch your leg only. They didn‚Äôt use any energy. Too overrated. Won‚Äôt visit again. 	Pleasant atmosphere, good surroundings. Personally, I was (foot massage), just stroked. No effort, no massage movements, just hands running along the leg. Feet were practically forgotten. But my wife was insanely delighted, although it is difficult to please her. 	I had a 60-minute deep tissue massage and a 60-minute facial massage with a cucumber mask. Well, the deep tissue massage wasn‚Äôt bad, but it wasn‚Äôt relaxing, that‚Äôs for sure. Noise came from outside, like clashing, talking, ringing, etc. After the masseuse finished, she started preparing for the facial massage for a while, meaning she went outside and didn‚Äôt say anything but left me there. Then, she returned and started the facial ‚Äúmassage,‚Äù which was ridiculous for 600 baht. All she did was scrub and clean my face for at least 30 minutes or more‚Ä¶ but no massage was done on my face other than fondling it, no muscle massage, or anything else. Meanwhile, I was cold due to the AC, so I asked her to turn it off, but she just put a towel on me. Later, I asked her again (at that point, when she was using a cold water-soaked sponge for the face cleaning), and she finally turned it off.  It‚Äôs not worth going here unless you want to throw 1,300 baht out the window for this nonsense. 	Me and my husband took Thai massage with oil at this place. It was a great experience. Totally loved it.‚ô•Ô∏è Hygiene is good. Experienced masseuse. 	Had a great Thai full body massage and gold mask facial at this spa. Very clean and fast service. The staff were friendly too! Highly recommend! 	Amazing place! Recommend! Great chairss (lazyboy-recliners) Relaxing music.	Place is clean but the massage is below average. 	Randomly stumbled into this massage place. They were incredibly friendly and I was really happy with the 1 hour Thai Traditional massage that I got. The price was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place. 	I just got a massage there‚Äîit obviously depends on the masseuse, but my masseuse was pretty unprofessional‚Äîshe kept talking throughout the massage, picked up the phone at one point, and ended the massage before the hour was over. It was uncomfortable, as I could feel she was rushing and not paying attention. It was almost to a point where I felt disrespected. 	wonderful experience the staff were ever so lovely and helpful as to accustoming to my needs. 	Nice, clean, calm setting. The masseuse very clearly knew her craft well. She found and kneaded all the knots and aches I had. Did the hemp oil massage and it definitely has me feeling relaxed right now. 	Obviously it is all  dependent on the masseuse, but my experience was bad. My masseuse was talking on the phone during my deep tissue massage. She did not care and was in a rush to leave. She lathered my face and nose with too much oil and had the AC blasted. She was not paying attention during the middle of it and accidentally slammed my face down on the table. I know they work really hard and are over worked at times so no hard feelings.
