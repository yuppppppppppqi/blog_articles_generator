Loved the <strong><u>Lazyboy recliners and relaxing music!</u></strong> An amazing place to unwind.
The <strong><u>hemp oil massage left me feeling incredibly relaxed</u></strong>. Masseuse kneaded all knots.
Foot massage felt more like rubbing shins, very little time spent on actual feet.
Therapist was talking on the phone and seemed rushed, accidentally hit my face.
