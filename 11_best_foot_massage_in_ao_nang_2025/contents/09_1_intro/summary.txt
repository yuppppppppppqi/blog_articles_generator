Burin Thai Massage
・Rating: 4.6
・Price: Moderate (potentially higher without promotions)
・Recommended: Resort guests or visitors wanting a professional massage in a clean, modern setting, possibly with good deals.
Located right inside the Ananta Burin resort, this place offers a really clean and modern environment for a massage. It feels quite <strong><u>professional</u></strong>, and many guests have praised the experienced therapists for providing truly <strong><u>relaxing and effective massages</u></strong>, whether it's Thai, aroma, or oil. I especially liked their foot massage – it felt almost magical! They often run promotions like 'buy 1 get 1 free', which makes the <strong><u>value much better</u></strong>, as it can be a bit pricier otherwise. While most experiences seem positive, there have been a couple of odd reports, like a masseuse falling asleep or therapists being distracted. Generally, though, it's a solid choice if you're staying nearby or want that polished resort spa feel.
