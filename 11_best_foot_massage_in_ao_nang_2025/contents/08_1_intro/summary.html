<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;"><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Oscar Thai Massage has a super friendly vibe, with both the staff and owner getting lots of praise for being welcoming. It's conveniently located near the Holiday Style Ao Nang Beach hotel.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
Many guests rave about the skilled therapists, particularly mentioning their knowledge of acupressure points – some even called it the <strong><u>best massage ever</u></strong>! They offer more than just massages, with foot scrubs, facials, and hair braiding available too. The prices are really affordable, offering <strong><u>great value</u></strong>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
However, the atmosphere is quite basic – think small, no AC, no music. There are also reports of inconsistency; some found therapists inexperienced, lacking pressure, or even distracted by their phones.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
So, while potentially <strong><u>fantastic</u></strong>, your experience might depend on the therapist you get.</p>
