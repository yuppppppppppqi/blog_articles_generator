・Rating: 4.4
・Price: Affordable / Good Value
・Recommended: Tourists nearby wanting friendly, affordable massages, okay with basic ambiance and potential therapist inconsistency.
Oscar Thai Massage has a super friendly vibe, with both the staff and owner getting lots of praise for being welcoming. It's conveniently located near the Holiday Style Ao Nang Beach hotel. Many guests rave about the skilled therapists, particularly mentioning their knowledge of acupressure points – some even called it the <strong><u>best massage ever</u></strong>! They offer more than just massages, with foot scrubs, facials, and hair braiding available too. The prices are really affordable, offering <strong><u>great value</u></strong>. However, the atmosphere is quite basic – think small, no AC, no music. There are also reports of inconsistency; some found therapists inexperienced, lacking pressure, or even distracted by their phones. So, while potentially <strong><u>fantastic</u></strong>, your experience might depend on the therapist you get.
