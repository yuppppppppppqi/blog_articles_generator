Kom, my therapist, was absolutely wonderful—her technique was both skilled and relaxing.  She worked out all the tension in my feet during the massage, making me feel completely at ease. The foot scrub was thorough and refreshing, leaving my feet soft and renewed. And the pedicure was done with such care, leaving my nails looking clean and well-groomed. The whole experience was refreshing and rejuvenating. Kom’s professionalism and warmth made the whole experience exceptional. Highly recommend both her and this service if you’re looking to pamper yourself! 	Simply the best massage I’ve had in Thailand this time. Honestly couldn’t fault it. Such friendly and welcoming therapists. For the equivalent of £7 I really feel it’s amazing value and anyone who can rate this place lower then 5star really needs to look them self in the mirror and ask could you find better for the price. Thank you so much we will defiantly be back. 	Friendly staff, very popular and busy. Don't expect tranquility. Unfortunately for me, I was short changed for time.  My 2hr was 20mins short. Still, people are piling through the door. 	We went here with friends. I took Classic Thai massage, as the lady at the door explained to us all the differences of which one is strong and which one has oil. The man who massaged me was very good at feeling when to press stronger and when to press less. After leaving the parlour I felled very relaxed. P.S. if you are looking for European standards you will not find them in Thailand in general, but this place was relatively clean.  I recommend 	Foot massage ok, but a lot depended on the masseuse. I had a fine one and my boyfriend was absolutely dissatisfied. It's a typical Thai massage place with overheated air conditioning and a room full of people. Your relaxation depends on a lot of factors. I have seen the full body massage rooms and very nice. 	The prices are really good, but they come with less atmosphere.  Did a traditional Thai massage with a man , it was OK, but the area was noisy with a lot of talks and cell messages around. Feels very packed. So it's a question of value per money . 	I always come back here for Thai Massage. The girls and boys are great at what they do. The Lady Boss is awesome too. She managed her team very well. 	WORST MASSAGE! I came because I saw good reviews in google. It has been the WORST massage I’ve received in 2 months in Thailand ( and I did a lot.).the “professional”  didn’t knew were to massage, I had to ask to do it stronger 2 times and nothing changed. The cuddle of my grandma are stronger than this massage. When he did shoulders he forgot to do on my left side and I had to tell him. When he did my head he was scratching, that’s all. I was thinking in leaving the bed the full hour of massage. My massage was interrupted, he left for some minutes in the middle of the session!	Be careful whenever you visit this place or better don’t visit it at all. The massage they offer is not professional at all, they rush and do it in least-effort way. The massage was supposed to last 1 hour 10 minutes people working they said but lasted 50 minutes. The place is cold and loud and the best part of my experience there was leaving. They tried to scam me by charging more money than I was supposed to pay at first and after leaving the place I realized there was money missing in my wallet! There is information written inside that they are not responsible for the lost (or rather stolen) belongings. They may claim there is cctv in the building but you leave the things where the massage is done, somewhere next to the bed and there is no cctv there obviously. There are no lockers where you could leave your stuff. People working there are very dishonest and they speak very poor English which makes it difficult to communicate, they speak English only when they want to, when you say something is wrong or your belongings are missing then suddenly everybody forgets how to speak English. I will never visit this place again. 	Aoun made very strong food massage. Helpful for runners legs :)  I love it. 	Everything about this place is AMAZING! From the moment you're greeted at the door till the end of service, such good vibes. We had a full body massage and foot reflexology and a manicure. The prices were affordable for such amazing service. Really felt welcome at every stage. 10/10 will definitely be returning any chance we get! 	Massage only lasted 45 minutes (not one hour as advertised) Not one of best we’ve had in Thailand. Would not return. 	Best place in Krabi!! Had the most amazing first night here, welcomed with open arms. The staff are very friendly and can’t do enough. If I could give 10 stars, I would. Highly recommended ✌️😎 … 	We tried multiple massages here from foot massage to full body massage.. all were out standing..personal preference classic Thai massage, done by Lin.. she was really good.. a must try. Others were equally nice.. do try massage from Nok, Bew, Lin and One.. thankyou all.. 	Massage was totally amazing!! Apple took care of me for 2 days in a row, I higher recommend her! Is amazing! Thank you 	I just had head, neck and shoulders massage. It was rather plain, they did not use at all any oils so it felt sometimes painful on the skin. You could also smell cigarettes thay the masseur was smoking before because she did not use the oil. I have comparison from similar massage in Bangkok and this was just a very mild version. It was not even very relaxing so rather OKish. 	Masseurs are not used to keeping the curtains closed for customers nicely , I am a privacy customer and this was not the place for me, the masseuse who gave me the massage had rough hands. It felt like she was giving me a free body exfoliation .
