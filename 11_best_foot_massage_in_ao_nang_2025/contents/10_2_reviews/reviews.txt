My foot massage with <strong><u>Kom</u></strong> was fantastic! She was skilled and made me feel totally relaxed.
Simply the <strong><u>best massage</u></strong> I've had in Thailand this trip, amazing <strong><u>value for money</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Aoun</u></strong> gave a very strong foot massage, which was really helpful for my runner's legs. Loved it!
Everything about this place is <strong><u>AMAZING</u></strong>! Such good vibes and affordable prices for great service.
<strong><u>Lin</u></strong> gave an outstanding classic Thai massage, really good technique. A must try!
Massage was totally amazing! <strong><u>Apple</u></strong> took care of me two days straight, highly recommend her!
The staff are very friendly and can't do enough. Felt welcomed with open arms. <strong><u>10/10 experience</u></strong>.
The man who massaged me was very good, felt very relaxed after leaving. Place was relatively clean.
Foot massage was ok, but quality really depended on the specific masseuse you got.
Massage lasted only 45 minutes instead of the advertised hour. Wouldn't go back.
