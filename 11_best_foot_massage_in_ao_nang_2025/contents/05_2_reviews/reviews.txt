Clean, cozy place with amazing ladies. <strong><u>Yum gave a great back massage!</u></strong> Fair prices.
Worst massage ever. Masseuses were weak, lacked strength despite asking for more pressure.
Atmosphere was chaotic and unprofessional, staff chatting constantly. Manager kept interrupting my massage.
