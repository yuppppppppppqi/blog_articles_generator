Jen my therapist was excellent and knew her job very well. Recommended! 	Had a few massages  and a foot scrub amazing people and amazing service best in AO NAng would highly recommend thank you love Chloe  Tom Alfie and Harry xxxx see you again xxx 	Absolutely amazing massage! Very friendly staff and owner. Today was the third day in a row that we went. The masseuses and masseurs both know which points to apply acupressure to relax and relieve pain. Just outside the hotel (Holiday Style Ao Nang Beach). After a hectic schedule in Pattaya and Bangkok, we felt truly relaxed after getting massages here. Prices are too good and all of the staff is very skilled. Must experience! Recommend-Oil Massage (light pressure), Thai Oil Massage (deep pressure), Foot Massage, Facial treatment and Hair braiding. Do visit! Also open from 10am to 11pm daily. 	Jane did a fantastic job on my husband. Foot scrub and foot massage.  Bee gave me a full oil massage and it felt like heaven after that. She knows her stuff and I felt soooo freaking good after.  Price was affordable and below 1000 bhat. If you’re in Ao Nang. Come here. Look for Bee ❤️	If you are looking for the best Thai massage shop experience I recommend you to try the job. The stuff is nice and polite 	I experienced the service on my final day here, and it was fantastic. The massage was incredibly relaxing and just what I needed. I will definitely book again the next time I'm in Krabi! 	My wife and I visited and booked 1 hour Thai massage. It was honestly the best massage we've ever been for. The therapists are very professional and know how to apply just the right amount of pressure. We left feeling so refreshed! Will definitely visit here again. 	The salon is quite small, without air conditioning or chillout atmosphere (no music a lots of light), the Thai massage is very bad. I've had several massages in Thailand and this one was unfortunately the worst. The masseuse didn’t do it with full commitment, as if she was tired, not strong enough, I did not relax or feel well massaged. Unfortunately, we do not recommend it. 	I’m afraid to say, that this was the worst massage I’ve ever had. The massage therapist seemed as though she was avoiding massaging my muscles, and instead proceeded to rub my skin, with no benefit. During the neck and back massage, she also firmly pressed along my spine, which was rather uncomfortable. During the 30 minute foot massage, she focused mainly on the top of my feet and ignored the underneath. On a positive note however, my partner had an enjoyable massage seemingly by a more experienced therapist, so it seems it would really depend on who you are being seen by. Overall, I would not recommend a visit here unfortunately. 	Best massage in Ao Nang so far . The place doesn't look lush at all but the massage I've received it's top notch.  Been there two times both masseuse applied the same technique which makes me believe that is a training in place.  First time was absolutely amazing, hard ( this is how I like it) done by the short lady with black long hair. Second time still good but not as hard as first time.  Paid 450 BHT for 1 hour Thai oil massage plus 50 BHT on both occasions tip the masseuse.  Highly recommended whilst in Ao Nang 👌. 	We went twice. The first time was great, but the second very disappointing. Initially my husband and I had the dry skin removed from our feet and had a back and neck massage. The masseuse was very meticulous and detail oriented. The second time we went for longer treatments- this time opting for full body 60 minute oil massage. My husbands masseur was clearly inexperienced, left my husband with terrible back pain and spent the best part of the hour texting on his phone, thinking that my husband would not see what he was doing. My masseuse was not quite as bad, but she was also on her phone regularly during the treatment and didn’t really apply any pressure. I felt like I was being stroked for an hour. In conclusion, try to get a booking with the older ladies rather than the younger staff who are lazy and disinterested! 	Great massage, very nice staff!! We came back here a few times 	The thai massage was the best massage I have ever had by miles! I could not recommend this place more highly! The people were so lovely and professional as well. 	I would recommend that you pay Oscar's a visit when in Krabi, all staff are well trained and prices very competitive.I had two body scrubs and oil management very relaxing 	Service at every level and impressive #Oscar Thai Massage 	I highly recommend their foot massage. It was incredibly cozy inside the shop and the staff are very professional and know how to do their job. Bravo 👏 … 	Got a fabulous oil massage here. Totally recommended. Not too intense and not too light.
