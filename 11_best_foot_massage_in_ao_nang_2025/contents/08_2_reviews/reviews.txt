Decent nice <strong><u>professional</u></strong> Thai massage. <strong><u>Jen</u></strong> was excellent and knew her job very well.
Absolutely amazing massage! Very <strong><u>friendly staff</u></strong> and owner, felt truly relaxed after.
<strong><u>Jane</u></strong> did a fantastic job on my husband's feet. <strong><u>Bee</u></strong> gave me a heavenly oil massage!
Experienced their service on my final day, it was fantastic and <strong><u>incredibly relaxing</u></strong>.
Best Thai massage we've ever had. Therapists are very <strong><u>professional</u></strong>, left feeling so refreshed!
The Thai massage was the best I've ever had by miles! <strong><u>Lovely and professional</u></strong> people.
Highly recommend their foot massage. <strong><u>Cozy shop</u></strong> and very professional staff.
Got a <strong><u>fabulous oil massage</u></strong> here. Not too intense, not too light. Totally recommended.
The salon is quite small, no AC or music. The Thai massage itself felt weak.
My masseuse seemed inexperienced, avoided muscles, and even pressed firmly on my spine uncomfortably.
