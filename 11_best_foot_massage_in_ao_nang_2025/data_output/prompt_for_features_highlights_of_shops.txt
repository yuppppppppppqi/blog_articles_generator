The atmosphere is relaxing, the service is excellent, and overall, it‚Äôs a place where you truly enjoy spending time.  I‚Äôd especially like to highlight Mon, the massage therapist who worked with me‚Äîshe did an amazing job! The massage was fantastic, and I left feeling completely refreshed.  Another great convenience is that the salon accepts card payments, which is really helpful.  Highly recommend this place! I will definitely come back. Trip type Vacation Service: 5 Location: 5	Had the most amazing traditional massage and foot massage. Worth the little trek off the beaten path. All the staff are lovely and you get little complimentary bits at the beginning before choosing and afterwards with a nice drink, crackers and hot flannel. If I could give 10 stars I would. 	Such a professional and lovely place! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, and the staff is incredibly skilled and welcoming. I can say this was the best massage I had in Thailand.  A special thank you for the after-massage cookies and tea‚Äîsuch a nice touch! If you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality massage, this is the place to go. I‚Äôll definitely be back next time ‚ù§Ô∏è Trip type Vacation Travel group Couple Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights Quiet, Great value 	During my trip, I visited this massage salon several times, and it became a special place for me to relax. I tried back massages (three sessions), an office retreat massage, hot coconut oil and aloe massage, a facial, and a pedicure. The salon made a great impression, and I will really miss this place. I hope to come back next year.  The atmosphere is wonderful: everything is very clean, cozy, and made with care. The staff are kind, friendly, and professional. Each therapist I had - worked in their own unique way, and all the treatments were excellent.  The only issue I had was during one back massage. The therapist seemed like she didn‚Äôt want to be there ‚Äî her movements were slow and without energy, like she was just waiting for the session to end. That made the hour feel a bit tiring for me too. But I understand this can happen, and all my other experiences were amazing.  Overall, I highly recommend this salon. Thank you for your care and professionalism! Trip type Vacation Travel group Friends Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	Went to Massage Corner for traditional hot coconut oil massages, along with my brother and sister‚Ä¶ Our therapists were Mon, Tuk and Pop; they were all great! The pressure was was awesome! Loved the location too, very accessible. Please do give Massage Corner a try, if you‚Äôre in Ao Nang! Trip type Vacation Travel group Family Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights Great view, Quiet, Great value 	Excellent massage by all standards. The best I‚Äôve experienced. I highly recommend this place. And especially my therapist AL Ta! :)  I told her about my knee injury and she took special care to ensure the pain was better. She was very technically sound and knew exactly what to do. Im super impressed by this place, will come back again! Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	Amazing service, from beginning to end. Very welcoming. Staff very kind. I got the body scrub with massage for 120 minutes. The best massage experience I have ever received. Thank you massage corner!!!	Must try the foot massage! It takes place outside on the soft sofa chairs, so you have the beautiful greenery and sounds of nature around you, with a perfectly comfortable temperature with the fan on, and Thai spa music. The holistic ‚Ä¶ More 	Easy to find location and very hospitable staff. The entire process was smooth and well thought about‚Ä¶ And the menu of options for massage was clear and detailed. Affordable prices; Very kind and welcoming staff; And amazing service.  We will be coming again! Thank you for making our first trip to Thailand memorable and our first authentic Thai massage a great experience! Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	I booked a 90 min package called Office Syndrome.  I really liked the message. The lady doing the massage was very attentive, gentle and made sure I was feeling comfortable.  After the massage I felt extremely relaxed and my body felt more free. It was my first massage experience and I would definitely want to repeat it. 	Highly recommended! ‚ô•Ô∏è  The best place to get a massage in Krabi. My wife and I took the essential oil massage and we had the best experience. We requested them to have the massage with a view they had and they were so kind to provide us. The staff was so polite and their massage was also the best. It was like a ride in heaven. They gave us a nice tea after the massage as well which was really delicious and unique. This place is too good to be true. If you are there, don't miss out. The location is a little bit far and a small slope, so if you are going by a walk, you might need some energy but it's still worth it. üòä 	Stopped in with three friends after a long trip around Thailand! We needed a relaxing day and we got it! Everyone was friendly, welcoming and the overall experience was great. I definitely would recommend coming by when you‚Äôre in town! 	This is a massage place. Definitely the best one I‚Äôve come across in Thailand. It‚Äôs not crowded enough because it‚Äôs not on the main road. But the masseurs knew their stuff well and we had the best experience so far. It was so relaxing that I slept during the massage and post the massage, felt super refreshed both mentally and physically (my skin was glowing!!) definitely worth a visit in ao nang? 	Fantastic massage place. It feels traditionally Thai and not overly luxurious. Simple. They allow you fill a consultation form before your massage which is nice to be able to tell them how intense the massage should be. my masseuse also spoke well enough English to allow me communicate during the massage and was attentive. The atmosphere is calm as well not chaotic at all and it was easy to relax. 	I had a sports massage and it was the best I‚Äôve ever had. It his was my first massage in Thailand and I‚Äôll be coming back for sure. 5 stars. Thank you very much. 	A totally different experience compared to the many "touristic" massage shops around the beaches. In Corner massage we understood immediately a higher level of customer care and kindness, totally worth to pay a little bit more to have a way better experience. Fully recommended!! 	Lovely foot massage! They provide a cool towel and cup of water when you arrive and they wash your feet for you before you enter. The vibe is very relaxing, the room for foot massages is open air with a fan (no AC) and looks out at lovely trees so you can hear birds and see squirrels. At the end they provide tea and cookies as well. Very clean and worth the walk away from the busy main street.

We got the after sun massage (60 min) with hemp seed oil (cannabis sativa).  Overall a lovely experience which I would recommend! 	In lazy dayz you can find everything you need to enjoy the evening. Nice selection of weed,  good quality clothes and thai massage. The owner is a nice guy who even ordered my size and sent it to me by mail to Koh Phangan. I'm sure you'll feel good here. 	Good massage. The person who guided us was well versed in English and helpful. 	Lovely staff, very clean salon and great pressure. Amazing value for money! I would definitely recommend! 	2 stars because I feel horrible for the lady that massaged me. When I walked in she went straight from massaging one lady, straight to me without washing her hands which grossed me out so bad but she was so sweet I didn‚Äôt want to say anything. The reception guy is also very sweet which is why I‚Äôm giving 2 stars.  I got a 1hr foot massage and about 10 minutes was actually spent on my feet. The rest was her just rubbing my shins. I‚Äôve been getting massages across Thailand for 10+ years so I know not to expect the best, but this was bad.  After my massage was finished she went straight from me to another woman again without washing her hands ü•¥  I also felt bad cause it was 3 people back to back basically without her getting even a minute break between. 	The massage is not professional. It‚Äôs like paying others to touch your leg only. They didn‚Äôt use any energy. Too overrated. Won‚Äôt visit again. 	Pleasant atmosphere, good surroundings. Personally, I was (foot massage), just stroked. No effort, no massage movements, just hands running along the leg. Feet were practically forgotten. But my wife was insanely delighted, although it is difficult to please her. 	I had a 60-minute deep tissue massage and a 60-minute facial massage with a cucumber mask. Well, the deep tissue massage wasn‚Äôt bad, but it wasn‚Äôt relaxing, that‚Äôs for sure. Noise came from outside, like clashing, talking, ringing, etc. After the masseuse finished, she started preparing for the facial massage for a while, meaning she went outside and didn‚Äôt say anything but left me there. Then, she returned and started the facial ‚Äúmassage,‚Äù which was ridiculous for 600 baht. All she did was scrub and clean my face for at least 30 minutes or more‚Ä¶ but no massage was done on my face other than fondling it, no muscle massage, or anything else. Meanwhile, I was cold due to the AC, so I asked her to turn it off, but she just put a towel on me. Later, I asked her again (at that point, when she was using a cold water-soaked sponge for the face cleaning), and she finally turned it off.  It‚Äôs not worth going here unless you want to throw 1,300 baht out the window for this nonsense. 	Me and my husband took Thai massage with oil at this place. It was a great experience. Totally loved it.‚ô•Ô∏è Hygiene is good. Experienced masseuse. 	Had a great Thai full body massage and gold mask facial at this spa. Very clean and fast service. The staff were friendly too! Highly recommend! 	Amazing place! Recommend! Great chairss (lazyboy-recliners) Relaxing music.	Place is clean but the massage is below average. 	Randomly stumbled into this massage place. They were incredibly friendly and I was really happy with the 1 hour Thai Traditional massage that I got. The price was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place. 	I just got a massage there‚Äîit obviously depends on the masseuse, but my masseuse was pretty unprofessional‚Äîshe kept talking throughout the massage, picked up the phone at one point, and ended the massage before the hour was over. It was uncomfortable, as I could feel she was rushing and not paying attention. It was almost to a point where I felt disrespected. 	wonderful experience the staff were ever so lovely and helpful as to accustoming to my needs. 	Nice, clean, calm setting. The masseuse very clearly knew her craft well. She found and kneaded all the knots and aches I had. Did the hemp oil massage and it definitely has me feeling relaxed right now. 	Obviously it is all  dependent on the masseuse, but my experience was bad. My masseuse was talking on the phone during my deep tissue massage. She did not care and was in a rush to leave. She lathered my face and nose with too much oil and had the AC blasted. She was not paying attention during the middle of it and accidentally slammed my face down on the table. I know they work really hard and are over worked at times so no hard feelings.

The massage itself was excellent, and the therapists were highly professional and skilled. The place itself is modern and clean, which was a big plus.  However, there were a couple of significant drawbacks. First, I opted for a foot massage, but the chair I was seated in was not comfortable at all. Unlike other massage places where the chair reclines like a bed for maximum relaxation, this one didn‚Äôt recline at all, making it hard to fully relax.  Additionally, the ambiance was lacking. The massage area was right near the entrance, only about a meter and a half from the doorway, so I could hear street noise, conversations, and the comings and goings of staff and other customers. This lack of a calm, secluded atmosphere really took away from the relaxation experience.  Considering the higher-than-average prices, I expected a more tranquil setting that would allow for a better overall experience. While the massage quality was top-notch, the environment didn‚Äôt support the full relaxation I was hoping for.  In conclusion, while the massage therapists are excellent and the place is clean and modern, the lack of a comfortable setup and a peaceful ambiance makes it hard to fully recommend. I hope they can improve these aspects to offer a more holistic relaxation experience in the future. 	This salon is great.  Upon arrival, you will be greeted by a pleasant aroma and very nice staff.  The massage is definitely worth the price.  I feel very rested and the back pain I came with is gone.  The manicure is ok, but not perfect.  The gel polish peels off after 3 days. 	Love this place. The massage was 10/10 and the staff is super professional and sweet. The place is very clean! 	Head Massage and Foot Reflexology - 1 hour total with Kenny and my husband had a Coconut full body massage. 10/10 all around! Such a lovely spot but yet so inexpensive, would defo return! 	The place looks very good from outside, we had a Thai massage with oil , which was pleasant and relaxing. The staff is really friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs possibile to pay by card with a 3% fee. 	Ive been in Thailand many times. This is one of the best massage I ever had in my life. The place was clean and the therapist was very polite. Jenny managed to crack my back so well. Highly recommended. 	Really impressed with this massage place in Ao Nang. It‚Äôs super clean and has a peaceful atmosphere that makes you feel at ease right away. The massage itself was great‚Äîprofessional and well done without being too expensive. I‚Äôve checked out a few places nearby, and this one definitely gives the best value for money. The staff are friendly and seem to know what they‚Äôre doing. If you want a solid massage in a tidy and chill environment, this is a great spot to go. Do not there is a 3% charge for credit card 	Absolutely wonderful traditional Thai massage. Great staff. Friendly and professional. Highly recommend! 	We passed by here randomly after lunch and decided to go in. So glad we did! The thai massage feels amazing, I got stretched and pulled in all kinds of ways but I feel so relaxed and my muscles are thankful we came here. Thank you ladies!! 	Amazing! Got the Thai full body massage and it was gentle but hard when needed. So relaxing inside and you are treated amazingly. Complimentary cup of tea at the end. Will definitely be back! 	I had a foot massage and it was awesome. Definitely worth the price. Ambiance was relaxing ü´∂üèº ‚Ä¶	Beautiful, relaxing experience! I had a traditional Thai massage one day then soothing head, neck & foot massage another time. Definitely recommend- should have come here every day! üôèüèª ‚Ä¶ 	I had a wonderful massage....the staff was friendly and welcoming... Minuses was so wonderful that I would recommend her to anyone that is coming to this location. 	Beautiful relaxing massage. The massage therapists take their time and ensure you feel comfortable and relaxed. Very good price. The salon is beautiful and you feel calm as soon as you walk in. Very clean and hygienic aswell. You get a warm tea at the end of your treatment which is a very nice touch. Thank you ü§ç ‚Ä¶ 	Recommended!!! This is the second time we back to the shop with the new renovation. Cozy place to relax when come to Krabi. Very professional massage service and friendly staffs. We will back again when we come to Krabi. 	Very good massage with very good ambience. You can truly relax in this calming place with very little noise from staff or outside. Did the aloe Vera treatment and was spoiled with tones of cream on top of a great massage. 	Beautifying little spa! Staff was amazing and service was great! Highly recommend will be coming back before I leave for another massage. My daughter loved her manicure .

I and my husband had a long vacation in thailand which ended today with the special thai massage provided by Natalie and Fai. My husband had back pain considering that natalie gave a professional massage accordingly. Fai was a sweet lady with expertise in massage who helped me relief my foot pain. Overall great experience üëåüèº 	Best massage in town! Highly recommended! Great service and lovely staff! üòÅ too bad I have to go back to California tomorrow. If not I will come back for sure. This is the best massage place in krabi. if I have a chance to give them more star, I will give them extra five more star. overall,My massage lady name Katie. so far she‚Äôs the best massage lady I ever have in Thailand. 	Wow!!!!! Wow !!! Wow !!! it was the most amazing massage we had in all our vacation!!!! And we did a lot :) but this massage is unforgettable! So professional Great and welcoming staff! Thank you so much for that treatment! üòçü•πüôèüèª 	Natalie gave me an amazing aloe vera massage that helped soothe my sunburn. She was absolutely fantastic. Very clean and well kept salon. Would highly recommend! 	We had a disappointing experience at velar Massage. While their rates match the market, the service quality is poor, especially for Indian customers. Only a 1 or 2 therapists seemed skilled, and each massage felt inconsistent. Customer service was unhelpful, and their packages felt manipulative. There are much better options in Thailand. Would not recommend. 	Fixed me right up! I was staying at the Centara Hotel opposite, and was training at the Khunsuek Muay Thai gym daily. I had multiple longstanding sprains and injuries before my visit to Thailand ranging from ankle, hip, shoulder, neck and elbow. I discussed my ailments with the receptionist and he advised on best massage therapy, which would still allow me to train. I opted for the symptomatic massage. This was an incredibly deep tissue massage, not for the faint hearted as there were elbows and knees being dug into muscles to soften them up and release knots. However, once the massage was finished, I felt fantastic and was able to train Muay Thai with less niggles. At the end of my Krabi trip, I had my second systematic massage and am currently writing this review without a single ache in any of the aforementioned injury spots. If you find yourself in Ao Nang, please check Velar Massage out, you will not regret it! 	Really loved the professional massage which was given by the amazing therapist. It‚Äôs a must try if you are in Krabi, they are best at it. 	Great massage place! Cozy atmosphere, gentle yet precise therapists, and super relaxing massages. The price is reasonable, and the service is so good that I‚Äôd definitely come back! 	Had a fantastic thai massage with oil from Natalie. Mama was ready for some me time and I came out feeling like a new woman! Great massage, perfect place, good price. Thank you Natalie! :) 	Best massage to go to in Krabi.. Both us when back to back days while we were there.. We tried both full body and foot massage.. The people there are so friendly and their skills are great.. Don't waste your time trying other massage on the street as the price is the same range.. Recommended.. Will definitely come back again here 	Had an amazing experience at Velar Massage in Krabi! My masseuse, Venn/Wenn, was fantastic‚Äîskilled, professional, and very attentive. We opted for a foot massage (45 mins) and a neck & shoulder massage (60 mins), and both were incredibly soothing and relaxing. The ambiance was calm, the staff and the people at front desk were friendly, and the rates were reasonable. Overall, a perfect spot to unwind after a long day. Highly recommended! 	Had one of the best massages iv ever had here. Very relaxing atmosphere friendly staff who know what they are doing. The only place i go to now for massages. Very reasonable price as well definately cant recommend this place enough. 	This place is a complete rip-off. They deceive tourists by placing extra footwear outside to make it seem like they're busy, but in reality, they have no clue about proper massage techniques. They randomly assign you to someone who clearly lacks training, apply any cream they have, and just go through the motions without actually providing a real massage. It‚Äôs nothing but a waste of money and time.  If you're looking for a proper massage, skip this place and head to Wayreach Massage, just 350 meters away. They charge the same but actually know what they're doing! Even they don't respect indians 	Best I've ever had. Lovely staff, very clean and definitely recommend 	Clean and tidy shop with friendly staff. I had a 60min essential oil whole body massage. The masseur was friendly and professional. The massage was delivered the right amount pressure and care. 450 bht Not the cheapest but definitely more professional üëå 	I had the back and shoulder Massage. Natalie was very lovley and did a amazing job. I felt so good after her Massage. Thank you so much üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Great foot massage. Smells very nice inside and quiet ambience. Daytime best for visiting

I can find my solution here. and they fixed my back. this place makes my back so much better. I'm happy to recommend  this place to everyone. here is Number 1 of my massage experiences in Thailand. I'm in Thailand every year from 2005 until now here is the best. 	This was by far the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. amazing job!"  The lady was professional her technique was perfect‚Äîcombining the right amount of pressure and skill to relieve tension in all the right spots. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a top-notch massage experience. I‚Äôll definitely be booking with her again!" 	I would not recommend this place for real massage. If you look for a place to hang out with friends while someone massages your foot, then it's okay. But i doubt you will do that. 	Love love it! Had a 1 hour facial done, and a 30 minute calve and foot massage. They used so many amazing products on my skin, left it feeling so rejuvenated and alive. The staff are so friendly and accommodated me so well. I had both treatments done the same time, felt like a queen. Would highly recommend! Feeling great 	Worst massage of my life and being south East Asian, I‚Äôve gotten many. Me and my family got body massages there this evening and it was extremely disappointing. I would consider the many other options around.  Firstly, one of us requested a Thai traditional massage but they messed up and gave him an oil massage instead.  the masseuses were weak. And lack strength despite 2 of us asking repeatedly for more strength to be applied. It felt like a child caressing and patting me instead.  The owner (man) later apologised and confessed that the masseuses he had given us were new to the job.  Terrible service. If the masseuses are not well trained yet please don‚Äôt assign them to customers. It‚Äôs unprofessional and we are full paying customers.  Owner told us that if we come back for another massage tomorrow he would give us a better staff and still charged us full price, despite me telling him that it was my last day in Krabi. üôÑ  I would take the good Google reviews of this place with a pinch of salt. It‚Äôs a massage place that just wants to service as many customers as possible with no regard to ensuring good quality. 	It's a nice place where we can talk and tell our massage needs, whether it's hand pressure or specific acupressure. The staffs are lovely. 	Went there for a 90 min oil massage.   A price was agreed upon and everything went well and we tipped the ladies.  Came back for a second massage a few days later and at the end of it the manager tried to ask for and extra 200baht each for both sessions (totalling 400 baht) claiming that the masseuse under charged us even tho she rang the manager and got a price at the start.  I feel this is a ploy the manager uses to get some extra cash on top of the original price.   Very disappointing as the massage itself and the ladies that did the massage were very nice.   Manager / owner is the issue. 	Talented and friendly staff, Loved their massage and the clean spa provide many services besides the health services, such as Lashes and and eye brows.. Manicure and eyeliner.. 	I just had the best massage of my life! The therapist was incredibly skilled, and every movement felt perfectly tailored to release tension and stress.I walked out feeling rejuvenated, lighter, and totally refreshed. Highly recommend this place 	If you would like to have a real Thai massage please don‚Äôt come here‚Ä¶ we spent an hour for nothing feel like massage.. Only oil with pushing not massaging Anyway, I am real Thai 	Both me and my partner had a Thai / oil massage there every day during our stay in Krabi. The staff is very nice and the lady who owns the place is very communicative in English and super kind. The studio is quite new, very clean. 	I wonder where all these positive reviews came from. Nobody spoke English, hence I couldn‚Äôt communicate with anyone. After mayor surgery and back problems for years I found it important to have someone experienced but instead I got an incredibly painful oil massage. 	The manager is super accommodating and fit our group in pretty quickly even though we showed up pretty late in the evening. My friend and I enjoyed our pedicures, and our whole group had nice massages.  However, the atmosphere here is far from relaxing. The staff is constantly chatting, and it was clear that they were talking about other clients. Also, they seem short staffed (again, I understand since they fit us in quickly at the end of the night) but the manager continued to wave new clients in even though there already weren‚Äôt enough masseuses. She got up several times during my massage to help other clients and to make calls. This atmosphere was chaotic and unprofessional.  Again, we really enjoyed our massages, but I wish the atmosphere was more peaceful. 	This was a scam. We went for a 1hr massage, and they wouldn‚Äôt do it because they were only available for 30min. They convinced us by telling we would pay only half of it (half of 1hr price), and explicitly said the amount. Then at the end after the massage, they charged us more money than the initial offered price. The lady in charge was rude and she + another lady were screaming just to intimidate us‚Ä¶. and since we didn‚Äôt want to end our day with a bad experience, we just paid whatever they asked and left. The massage was more than the average, and with so many options around, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. 	My friends and I I had several foot massages and a back/neck massage. The place is clean and cozy and the ladies are amazing. Prices are also very fair and it can be perfectly combined with the AoNang night and food market. Also special thanks to Yum who did a great job on the back massage and had a great sense of humour. Thanks for everything and we‚Äòll certainly check-in should we ever get back to Krabi. Only attention point and potential room for improvement is the music system that is not working well and that is somehow disturbing the cozy massage atmosphere.	The best place ever for donig massage.. they doing excellent job 	We picked the foot massage and one manicure. The massage was fine but the manicure service was rude and hurting hands. When we did a remark, she rolled her eyes and sighed. She talked like she was annoyed when we told her it hurted. It kinda annoyed us. In the end, even though we paid for the service, she told all of us to get out when she didn‚Äôt finish the manicure. We didn‚Äôt even get a refund for it.

I wanted a nice relaxing massage but the masseuse had other plans there was no pressure at all and the person was doing some weird massage near my junk even when i specifically asked for a leg and lower back massage. I Felt very uncomfortable during the whole experience. If I could give a negative star I would. 	Such a great experience! Me and my friend opted for a full body oil massage and we were able to keep the curtain open between us to still have a joint experience - was really hygienic and professional and the members of staff are SO SO lovely!! Would highly recommend!! 	Having been in Thailand for two weeks, I had walked past many message opportunities. But this was my birthday and what a perfect day to try this local business. What a wonderful immersive body experience. My spouse and I were greeted by the owner. Two spots were available. We were led to two curtained rooms, side-by-side. Over the next hour my muscles were messaged carefully yet deeply. The session concluded with some selective body stretching all the while listening closely for any signs of discomfort. I left feeling refreshed and wishing I could make a visit to this business a weekly pleasure. Highly recommend. Very reasonable prices. 	Did a Thai massage for 299 baht and was very happy! Had other Thai massages in Thailand and this is one of the best! Their technique was very good 	Best massage is krabi !!!! You must try it! 	Best first Thai massage ~! Thank u oasis for making this experience wonderful ! Great massage & atmosphere ‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô° ‚úßÀñ¬∞ 	Tjuv was the best massage therapist I had a full body massage with 100% coconut oil it was super I really enjoyed the massage I recommend 	The best massage in Krabi, professional and welcoming! Will come back again. 	The best spa in Ao Nang. Have been there several times Professional staff and friendly service ü´∂. ‚Ä¶ 	Nice massage! Body feel relieved n relax! Friendly staff. 	Great massage! Thank you for the warm welcome. 	Don‚Äôt go here, they don‚Äôt know what they are doing. We waited 30 minutes because they didn‚Äôt have enough people. Not relaxing waste of 800 baht	The worst massage i have ever seen in the world 	Had a very good massage from a friendly lady. Highly recommended for everyone! 	The shop is clean, the masseuses are good, and the service is very good. I would recommend this shop.

Jen my therapist was excellent and knew her job very well. Recommended! 	Had a few massages  and a foot scrub amazing people and amazing service best in AO NAng would highly recommend thank you love Chloe  Tom Alfie and Harry xxxx see you again xxx 	Absolutely amazing massage! Very friendly staff and owner. Today was the third day in a row that we went. The masseuses and masseurs both know which points to apply acupressure to relax and relieve pain. Just outside the hotel (Holiday Style Ao Nang Beach). After a hectic schedule in Pattaya and Bangkok, we felt truly relaxed after getting massages here. Prices are too good and all of the staff is very skilled. Must experience! Recommend-Oil Massage (light pressure), Thai Oil Massage (deep pressure), Foot Massage, Facial treatment and Hair braiding. Do visit! Also open from 10am to 11pm daily. 	Jane did a fantastic job on my husband. Foot scrub and foot massage.  Bee gave me a full oil massage and it felt like heaven after that. She knows her stuff and I felt soooo freaking good after.  Price was affordable and below 1000 bhat. If you‚Äôre in Ao Nang. Come here. Look for Bee ‚ù§Ô∏è	If you are looking for the best Thai massage shop experience I recommend you to try the job. The stuff is nice and polite 	I experienced the service on my final day here, and it was fantastic. The massage was incredibly relaxing and just what I needed. I will definitely book again the next time I'm in Krabi! 	My wife and I visited and booked 1 hour Thai massage. It was honestly the best massage we've ever been for. The therapists are very professional and know how to apply just the right amount of pressure. We left feeling so refreshed! Will definitely visit here again. 	The salon is quite small, without air conditioning or chillout atmosphere (no music a lots of light), the Thai massage is very bad. I've had several massages in Thailand and this one was unfortunately the worst. The masseuse didn‚Äôt do it with full commitment, as if she was tired, not strong enough, I did not relax or feel well massaged. Unfortunately, we do not recommend it. 	I‚Äôm afraid to say, that this was the worst massage I‚Äôve ever had. The massage therapist seemed as though she was avoiding massaging my muscles, and instead proceeded to rub my skin, with no benefit. During the neck and back massage, she also firmly pressed along my spine, which was rather uncomfortable. During the 30 minute foot massage, she focused mainly on the top of my feet and ignored the underneath. On a positive note however, my partner had an enjoyable massage seemingly by a more experienced therapist, so it seems it would really depend on who you are being seen by. Overall, I would not recommend a visit here unfortunately. 	Best massage in Ao Nang so far . The place doesn't look lush at all but the massage I've received it's top notch.  Been there two times both masseuse applied the same technique which makes me believe that is a training in place.  First time was absolutely amazing, hard ( this is how I like it) done by the short lady with black long hair. Second time still good but not as hard as first time.  Paid 450 BHT for 1 hour Thai oil massage plus 50 BHT on both occasions tip the masseuse.  Highly recommended whilst in Ao Nang üëå. 	We went twice. The first time was great, but the second very disappointing. Initially my husband and I had the dry skin removed from our feet and had a back and neck massage. The masseuse was very meticulous and detail oriented. The second time we went for longer treatments- this time opting for full body 60 minute oil massage. My husbands masseur was clearly inexperienced, left my husband with terrible back pain and spent the best part of the hour texting on his phone, thinking that my husband would not see what he was doing. My masseuse was not quite as bad, but she was also on her phone regularly during the treatment and didn‚Äôt really apply any pressure. I felt like I was being stroked for an hour. In conclusion, try to get a booking with the older ladies rather than the younger staff who are lazy and disinterested! 	Great massage, very nice staff!! We came back here a few times 	The thai massage was the best massage I have ever had by miles! I could not recommend this place more highly! The people were so lovely and professional as well. 	I would recommend that you pay Oscar's a visit when in Krabi, all staff are well trained and prices very competitive.I had two body scrubs and oil management very relaxing 	Service at every level and impressive #Oscar Thai Massage 	I highly recommend their foot massage. It was incredibly cozy inside the shop and the staff are very professional and know how to do their job. Bravo üëè ‚Ä¶ 	Got a fabulous oil massage here. Totally recommended. Not too intense and not too light.

Massage is decently good but a bit pricey without promotion 	Amazing massage experience. I had 1h Thai full body massage from Ananta Burin resort and it was super relaxing and professional. You feel the experience and quality. The building is super clean and modern. 	So good. What a find!! Service was second to none....even after checkout. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Krabi! 	I don‚Äôt even know how to describe what that was xd an old masseuse during a coconut oil massage spent the first 40 minutes awkwardly rubbing various parts of my body. After that, she fell asleep over me XDD I got up and left, there was no point in enduring this drama for another 40 minutes. 	Massage was awful. I ask for a sport massage, but it wasn't. Soft oil massage only. No help, no english communication at all. Don't recommend at all. You could find better massage and 2-3 times cheaper then there 	We received 2 free massages with our booking as we booked direct. We also made use of their buy 1 get 1 free promo for aroma massage. The staff were friendly, welcoming and accepted that as a single adult travelling with 3 young children the toddler would be in the room with me. Easy booking procedure and would recommend. 	My family of four just had one of the best aroma wat pho oil massage, the ladies were really good. Very happy customers 	Loved the whole experience, the lady was brilliant, I had a balm and oil which was just what I wanted. Will be going again 	Great service. We felt so relaxed and loved the massage experience. It is worth the price. Heartily thankful to the staff members. Also the vibe at massage parlour was very peaceful and pleasant. 	Great massage place in Ao nang. The lady is really good. I feel extremely relaxed and calm after session. Also very low prices! 	Body massage was very good. They massage very well. I feel very relaxed. 	Relaxing and a bit painful as they massage your points deeply , a must try for a life time experience, good hotel as well	The manager so good in handling us and upgraded our room Thanks ya 	Best resortbfor families and groups. Lovely breakfast menu and in house massage house. Highly recommend to saty over 3 days 	The foot massage here is really really good, somewhat magical. My husband and I almost fell asleep during the massage. Would highly recommend. 	Came here for a back/neck and shoulders massage and found it to be decent. I requested a male masseur due to the strength difference I have noticed in Thailand and that was no issue.  My friend settled for a lady massuese due to no more males being available and she found her massage to be okay/nice as well.  The lady though she had kept opening the curtains between us and laughing and trying to converse with my masseur, which was a bit annoying to be honest. Upon the moment they were stretching my friend she opened the curtains again, after I myself closed them and my masseur seriously got flashed due to my friend's bare chest.  Since all the professionala got called after 4 people requested a massage I am assuming they have certain people on speeddile and whomever responses the quickest, gets the deal.  For the nice resort that they are I was expecting more professionalism from the masseuse.  I overall had a good massage, yet I do not need to see someone elses face and hear that curtain be opened 10times in a row after my masseur and myself closed it.  Focus on your own client, that might be a better work strategy. 	I am having the massage for 2nd time. The massuer is professional with skillful hands, perfect for relaxing after the tiring trip. I always been to Healthland for massage before, this is definitely better than that.

Kom, my therapist, was absolutely wonderful‚Äîher technique was both skilled and relaxing.  She worked out all the tension in my feet during the massage, making me feel completely at ease. The foot scrub was thorough and refreshing, leaving my feet soft and renewed. And the pedicure was done with such care, leaving my nails looking clean and well-groomed. The whole experience was refreshing and rejuvenating. Kom‚Äôs professionalism and warmth made the whole experience exceptional. Highly recommend both her and this service if you‚Äôre looking to pamper yourself! 	Simply the best massage I‚Äôve had in Thailand this time. Honestly couldn‚Äôt fault it. Such friendly and welcoming therapists. For the equivalent of ¬£7 I really feel it‚Äôs amazing value and anyone who can rate this place lower then 5star really needs to look them self in the mirror and ask could you find better for the price. Thank you so much we will defiantly be back. 	Friendly staff, very popular and busy. Don't expect tranquility. Unfortunately for me, I was short changed for time.  My 2hr was 20mins short. Still, people are piling through the door. 	We went here with friends. I took Classic Thai massage, as the lady at the door explained to us all the differences of which one is strong and which one has oil. The man who massaged me was very good at feeling when to press stronger and when to press less. After leaving the parlour I felled very relaxed. P.S. if you are looking for European standards you will not find them in Thailand in general, but this place was relatively clean.  I recommend 	Foot massage ok, but a lot depended on the masseuse. I had a fine one and my boyfriend was absolutely dissatisfied. It's a typical Thai massage place with overheated air conditioning and a room full of people. Your relaxation depends on a lot of factors. I have seen the full body massage rooms and very nice. 	The prices are really good, but they come with less atmosphere.  Did a traditional Thai massage with a man , it was OK, but the area was noisy with a lot of talks and cell messages around. Feels very packed. So it's a question of value per money . 	I always come back here for Thai Massage. The girls and boys are great at what they do. The Lady Boss is awesome too. She managed her team very well. 	WORST MASSAGE! I came because I saw good reviews in google. It has been the WORST massage I‚Äôve received in 2 months in Thailand ( and I did a lot.).the ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù  didn‚Äôt knew were to massage, I had to ask to do it stronger 2 times and nothing changed. The cuddle of my grandma are stronger than this massage. When he did shoulders he forgot to do on my left side and I had to tell him. When he did my head he was scratching, that‚Äôs all. I was thinking in leaving the bed the full hour of massage. My massage was interrupted, he left for some minutes in the middle of the session!	Be careful whenever you visit this place or better don‚Äôt visit it at all. The massage they offer is not professional at all, they rush and do it in least-effort way. The massage was supposed to last 1 hour 10 minutes people working they said but lasted 50 minutes. The place is cold and loud and the best part of my experience there was leaving. They tried to scam me by charging more money than I was supposed to pay at first and after leaving the place I realized there was money missing in my wallet! There is information written inside that they are not responsible for the lost (or rather stolen) belongings. They may claim there is cctv in the building but you leave the things where the massage is done, somewhere next to the bed and there is no cctv there obviously. There are no lockers where you could leave your stuff. People working there are very dishonest and they speak very poor English which makes it difficult to communicate, they speak English only when they want to, when you say something is wrong or your belongings are missing then suddenly everybody forgets how to speak English. I will never visit this place again. 	Aoun made very strong food massage. Helpful for runners legs :)  I love it. 	Everything about this place is AMAZING! From the moment you're greeted at the door till the end of service, such good vibes. We had a full body massage and foot reflexology and a manicure. The prices were affordable for such amazing service. Really felt welcome at every stage. 10/10 will definitely be returning any chance we get! 	Massage only lasted 45 minutes (not one hour as advertised) Not one of best we‚Äôve had in Thailand. Would not return. 	Best place in Krabi!! Had the most amazing first night here, welcomed with open arms. The staff are very friendly and can‚Äôt do enough. If I could give 10 stars, I would. Highly recommended ‚úåÔ∏èüòé ‚Ä¶ 	We tried multiple massages here from foot massage to full body massage.. all were out standing..personal preference classic Thai massage, done by Lin.. she was really good.. a must try. Others were equally nice.. do try massage from Nok, Bew, Lin and One.. thankyou all.. 	Massage was totally amazing!! Apple took care of me for 2 days in a row, I higher recommend her! Is amazing! Thank you 	I just had head, neck and shoulders massage. It was rather plain, they did not use at all any oils so it felt sometimes painful on the skin. You could also smell cigarettes thay the masseur was smoking before because she did not use the oil. I have comparison from similar massage in Bangkok and this was just a very mild version. It was not even very relaxing so rather OKish. 	Masseurs are not used to keeping the curtains closed for customers nicely , I am a privacy customer and this was not the place for me, the masseuse who gave me the massage had rough hands. It felt like she was giving me a free body exfoliation .
