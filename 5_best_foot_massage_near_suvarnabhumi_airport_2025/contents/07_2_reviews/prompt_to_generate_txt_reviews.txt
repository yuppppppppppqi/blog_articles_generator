The staff here are polite, attentive, and really care about every detail. The prices are very reasonable, and the massage was absolutely amazing 💆‍♀️  I tried the 1-hour aromatherapy massage for 900 baht, and it was so relaxing — it truly helped melt away all the stress. The atmosphere in the shop is very calming, clean, and cozy. I felt completely relaxed and even fell asleep during the session 😂  Free parking is available, but finding a spot can be a bit tricky during evening hours. If you’re coming after 5 PM, I recommend booking ahead and coming a little early. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind! 	Only have 2 rooms to do aroma massages if I’m not wrong. Tried body scrub and aroma massage, 2 hours. (45mins body scrub+15mins bath+1 hour aroma massage) When doing body scrub the air conditioner was very strong and the blanket is very thin. Which lead me to had goosebump the whole treatment. For the aroma (finally got thick blanket), the massage on foot was strong, and focus on massaging it, which is good and comfortable. But on the other hand makes massage on back and upper body part a bit perfunctory. The time of massaging each body part was not quite balance. 	The traditional Thai massage was amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxing with calming music, and the masseuse made sure to cater the massage to my specific needs. I felt so taken care of 😊 thank you!! …	Nice experience, I tried aroma massage (1.30hrs = 1,000Bht) it was relaxing, great massage place. Room was perfectly clean and soothing, good quality with a reasonable price. Lots of free parking in the shopping area.  Definitely come back again, Highly recommended. 😁 	Lovely little massage shop located in the back part of Little Walk Bangna. The massage therapist are professional and everything is very clean. I’ve been here 5 or 6 times and will continue to come. The hot stone massage is highly recommended too. 	probably the best Thai massage I've ever experienced. The room is so clean and tranquil, and also it smells very refreshing. Massager is good and polite, I would for sure visit again. 	Best price quality massage service in Bangna area. Place is very clean and comfortable. Got different masseuse everytime I went and all of them were very highly skilled. Only drawback is that you have to book early. Very difficult to find slots on weekend. 	Good place, very professional, experienced ad friendly masseuses doing good massages. Bit hurting sometimes but they know how to do their jobs. Free hot tea afterwards. We booked a head & shoulder massage and 3 foot massages. The receptionist was very friendsly and flexible with the appointments. Even the foot massage had a finishing head & neck therapy. Recommended ✌️ 	Excellent massage place. Must book in advance, can't just walk in. Mostly it is full. Highly recommended 	Wide arrange of massages available, very different experience than massage parlors I have visited previously.  Kind and experienced staff. The lady at the front desk is also very warm and kind. Definitely recommend this place whilst at little walk bangna! 👐 	Very nice Thai Massage parlor.....I requested for a deep tissue massage and Ms.Tik was assigned for me....she was very professional & an expert in her job....I felt rejuvenated & completely relaxed.This is the 2nd time I took the services & will go again.Will recommend anytime. 	Seriously great massage. Clean and professional. A little more expensive than the average but well worth it. 	Excellent massage, very professional place, friendly staff. There are cheaper massages available in the area but probably won’t be as good as here. 	One of the best Thai massage I have experienced. Clean and professional service. Highly recommend. 	After looking at this place from thainakrin hospital room I had to treat myself to a thai and aromatherapy massages - both were awesome and girls are fabulous - ambiance  is delightful THANKS 😃 … 	One of the best reflexology spa I have been! Very friendly staffs and welcoming (and beautiful) lady boss:) 	Good Service Mind, Massage Skill, Clean and atmosphere 	Location is convenience, but the massage is not quite comfortable. 	Very relaxing, friendly staff & clean 	#ERROR!
