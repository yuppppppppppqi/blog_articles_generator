The ambiance is comfortable, though the air conditioning can get a bit chilly if you’re sitting directly under it—don’t hesitate to ask for a blanket if you feel cold.  The masseuses are skilled and provide a good foot massage, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of service. I haven’t tried their Thai massage yet, but based on my experience with the foot massage, I  had a good session.  One thing to note is that the place accepts cash only, so make sure to have some on hand. It’s also customary to tip the masseuse after the session, which is a nice way to show appreciation for their work.  Overall, Foot Massage Balsabai is a solid choice for a relaxing massage in the Sukhumvit area. I’d recommend it for anyone looking for a clean and professional massage experience. 	I haven't noticed this place before and I thought it was rather new, but it has been opened for quite some time. I was staying at the hotel opposite and I came across this place one night on my way back and decided to give it a try. There were quite a lot of people waiting but I didn't take long to get someone to serve me. Furnishing is quite modern and the massage chairs looks new and clean. I requested for a male masseur and got one and I was impressed with his skills and his pressure. As usual, there was washing of the feet before massage and tea was served after the massage. It is one of the most quiet place I have done a massage so far, seems like they refrain the customers and the staff from talking so the environment is very conducive. I would return and would also recommend this place to try foot massage. Price is slightly more expensive then the usual massage places but I guess it is worth it for the environment and the quality of the massage. It deserves more than a 4 stars, maybe a 4.5. 	Fresh off a flight and needed to relax. Great that they were open until midnight. On a fairly busy street. The price was reasonable and it was a very clean and modern environment. Looked like a very new establishment. I asked for a strong masseuse because I like it strong. Thought it was a great and relaxing. 	Simple, clean and no frills foot massage. I appreciate how focused the massage was and enjoyed the 1hr session with my male masseuse. Paid 399baht. 	It’s good, clean place and lots of sofas available but it’s like double the price of most foot massages in BKK. I recon it’s beside Marriott so it’s all tourists 	I have forced myself to provide a 5 star review for this business because it was really 5 star service. The foot massage was so relaxing that I fell asleep during my 30 min massage. It was very therapeutic and satisfying after a long day of exploring Bangkok and my legs were numb and hurting. The staff were so polite and caring, they wash your feet well before starting the treatment. They are located at a prime location right outside Marriott. I highly recommend this business to anyone traveling into Bangkok. 	This is one of the few green spas on this street, and the massage therapists are genuinely hardworking. But is there a downside? Absolutely and it’s a major one. The overweight woman at the front desk is unbelievably rude and lacks basic manners, enough to ruin your entire experience here. 	highly recommended massage after a tiring day. I opted for foot massage for an hour and it was truly relaxing. I was embarrassed to sleep twice during the massage as it was so relaxing. They offer green tea after the massage. 	This place has a good price for a 1 hour massage, is focused on foot massages so the masseuses are all trained for that, and has comfy chairs. Easy for a quick in and out! Good location if you’re staying at the hotels nearby. 	Went here multiple times and always got a great foot massage! They make sure you’re comfortable and offer a great service, also late in the evening! 	Best place. So calm, relaxing place with good music. We loved the massage from the start to finish. Best place we have been to so far. Reasonable prices; 10.5€ We really recommend it! 	Not sure why they don't accept the online booking? I was call trying to get a booking beforehand but they rejected. Have been told Only for walk-in...I have been so many massage places, such a Health land, let's relax and many places. They all accept online booking. What a regret. 	Excellent foot massage experience! Skilled therapist, calming ambiance, and great value. Highly recommended 	If you're staying across from the Marriott, this is the massage parlour with the best business! The parlour's facade is entirely made of glass and you can see it's virtually full all the time. Foot massages get topped up with a top body massage. Look for Joe... He's the best! I discovered bones in my body I never knew I had 😂 … 	Clean, quiet, professional and reasonably priced. Better than most other ones on the street which appear more dodgy. Lovely staff. They only do foot massage. May feel a bit industrial but it’s not. And they all have the same technique so you can tell they’ve had training. I recommend 	Popular foot massage by tourists, good location next to metro station & several hotels, clean massage chair, friendly staff, professional massage, slightly pricey than other nearby massage shops. 	I was looking for a place that would offer a good strong memorable foot massage is a nice clean atmosphere. I found it here. Easy to get to. The staff were attentive, the chairs were comfortable and the atmosphere lovely. The women who worked on my feet for 90 min did an outstanding job. If you are here on vacation and need a foot massage, I highly recommend this shop.	We were fooled by the nice decor. Weak foot massages with lots of flowing movements but barely any pressure. Both my wife and I experienced the same. Never again. 	I took 30-minutes foot massage and it was great. Very nice staff, comfortable chairs and calm music. I will be back for sure. 	This is a great Foot Massage establishment. Not intimidating to enter as there are no aggressive sales ladies out front. This place was packed when I was there and yet quiet enough to get everyone being treated nice and relaxed.  Great price and friendly staff.  Will be going back before I leave this land of smiles.
