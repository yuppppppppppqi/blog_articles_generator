This was the absolute worst oil massage I‚Äôve ever had. No elbows, no proper stretching, no deep tissue, nothing. All the way up to the end where I was expecting a solid shoulder massage. Nope. Apparently my girlfriend had a good massage but she isn‚Äôt the one leaving a review. Not sure why they chose the weakest link to massage me, but on top of all that I was ticklish the ENTIRE time. Which has never happened in 15 years of massages a good place will not tickle you over and over to the point you‚Äôre uncomfortable. Ridiculous. 	Very good and professionel massage. Shop clean and airconditioned.  Nuad dee mak	One of the best massages I ever had in Thailand. Very clean place, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff :) would highly recommend to anyone! 	It was the best spa I have ever been..from the prices to the reception and specially the massage..all my tiredness from the flight was instantly gone with such a nice and professional massage..will definitely go again next week until I am in Thailand and recommend to everyone. 	Simple massage parlour with very friendly and experienced masseuses. My husband and I had excellent massages and will be back soon. Several massage options available for a range of durations. 	I would recommend this Spa, best thai massage. Therapist are well knowledge on how to give thai massage and accupressure points.  ,, "‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Love this team ever 	This is a great place for health and relaxation. I thank the staff for their work, professionalism and care! 	Great service!

We'll definitely come back. üáπüá≠üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	I like it .  thanks for the good massage 	Very nice place and professional massage serviceüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª ‚Ä¶ 	An unforgettable experience for all three We visited SUPAWADEE MASSAGE and left completely delighted. I received a Thai Balm massage, my girlfriend a leg massage and my mother an oil massage... and all three of us agreed on the same thing: it was incredible!  The place is clean, quiet and very cozy. The masseuses are true professionals, with expert hands who know exactly how to relieve tension and take care of every detail. The Thai Balm massage was deep and revitalizing, ideal for unloading the entire body. My girlfriend was delighted with the work on her legs, and my mother floated away from the oil massage.  You can see that there is passion here for what they do. It is not just another massage place: it is a real wellness center. We will return without hesitation every time we are in the area.  A big thank you to the SUPAWADEE team for taking such good care of us. Totally recommended! 	The service is very good. The owner of the shop is cute. Good masseuse, spacious room, will definitely come back again. 	It's hard to beat a Thai massage in Bangkok, but I discovered this place by chance because I was staying near the airport and it was definitely my best discovery. I immersed myself in a two-hour massage along with a very delicate exfoliation that left me feeling like new. Without a doubt when I return I will repeat. Super recommended!! 	Felt like home, good service, spacious room, clean cloth, good masseuse, will definitely come back again. 	The room is very spacious, the reception is good, the masseuse is good, the linens are very clean.	The massage shop is clean, the masseuse is very good, I recommend it. 	It's a good shop, I recommend it. Good service, good massage, spacious room 	The room is spacious, the cloth is clean, the masseuse is good.  Definitely come back again. 	The masseur's skills are very good, the reception staff is very enthusiastic, the environment in the store is clean but the signs of time can be seen, and parking is available at the door.	Good masseuse, good manners, good service, clean room, reasonable price, impressed from the first time. Definitely come back to use the service again.
