Overall nice relax and staff was nice service and not talk too much. Enjoy to relax and reasonable price. Strong massage enough,I like here. 	Just had the most amazing massage at Bangna Area! The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and the place was spotlessly clean with private rooms for couples and individuals. There was plenty of parking, and it's conveniently close to the airport. I treated myself to a coconut scrub and an aroma massage, and let me tell you, my skin feels incredibly smooth, and my muscles are so relaxed! It's exactly what I needed after all the sports activities I've been doing. 	Here‚Äôs a concise and natural review based on your experience:  I had an absolutely wonderful experience with both the aroma massage and facial treatment! The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing, the space was clean, and the staff were polite and highly experienced. The scents used in the aroma massage were soothing, and the facial left my skin feeling refreshed. I felt completely pampered and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a top-notch massage and facial!  Feel free to tweak it to match the specific place or add more details if you‚Äôd like!	Good massage place . Many korean tourists over the weekend. . You should make reservations before you go. But weekdays are ok to go walk in.	Wan was great to me, she did a 120 min Thai massage and was strong handed until the very last minute. Thank you for your effort. Great team and ambience. ü•≠üçµüíÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI will be back and I recommend highly! I walked out feeling like newborn.ü´∂ ‚Ä¶ 	It was a really pleasant and lovely massage!  We went there right before we go to the airport. It was so good that we could take a shower before we get on the plane at late night. Everyone was so kind there also. Reasonable price, clean and good massage skill. Definitely will go again when i visit Bangkok again!	Less than 30min by taxi from the airport. I hugely recommend to someone who need relaxation after a long trip before going back to your home. I made a reservation days before via Messenger. There are menu and price list on their Facebook page, so you can see your preference. I received total three hours package G; scrub, oil massage and facial hydration massage. It was all great. They offered me cut mango + lotus tea after the treatment. They kindly arranged a taxi dropoff to the airport, which was actually cheaper than Grab‚Ä¶ costed 240thb. Overall good hospitality. Note that the place is on 2nd floor of the building, and the entrance is within the courtyard not faced on the street. 	There is an empirical rule in massage shops in Thailand. In most cases, it's not the place, it's the lady. In my case, I have had much better experiences in regular places, than in fancy places like this one. But at least, when I pay 400 baht for Thai massage, I expect the manager to have only professional stuff. Today I was massaged by an amateur. The 1-star goes to the shop. People should be aware that they might not get a class-A massage here, despite the very good reviews. 	I just had the best massage of my life here at Koko Massage and Spa. My whole body was aching from work and I tried their therapeutic massage for office syndrome. The strength used is just nice and the masseuse is pressing on all the right parts. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Bangkok! 	KOKO Massage & Spa is one of the best spa in Bangkok. Whenever I visit Bangkok, I always come here for a massage. The therapists' skills are very good. "Office Syndrome" massage course is recommended. 	I have been living in Bangkok for over 5 years and this place is one of the best. The facility is much nicer then the price reflects. The massage therapist will tailor the massage your pleasure. I highly recommend this place. 	We choosed package C. They gave us 2 hrs service and after the massage, they gave us mango and tea. The massage skill was really good. And the people was really kind. Thank you! 	Loved this place so much we came twice.  It's less than 30 minutes from the airport, and it was actually on the way from our hotel in Bangkok.  The service is great (welcome drinks and mango dessert after), and they provide a couples room for anybody coming together.  The prices are very great as well, and I would recommend this to anybody considering a massage. We did package F the first time which was great starter for a 3 hr massage started with a body scrub. The second time we received 1 hr thai massage and 1 hr head neck shoulder massage- highly recommend! 	Pricey compared to other local Thai massage places. But it's not in vain. They do try to make your experience relaxing from the very first moment you walk into the door.  Massage itself was OK. Not bad. I had a private room for scrub and oil massage.  It was quiet and I was able to take shower right before massage, which is helpful for hot, sweaty Thai days 	Great overall service and best massage of my life!!! 1000000/10 üòç The owner was very kind and charismatic, staffs very attentive and the therapist skillful. I‚Äôm coming back next time for sure. Everyone should try KOKO massage when in Thailand. 	The spa itself has a great atmosphere, it‚Äôs very clean, calm and inviting for both men and women. I‚Äôve gone twice. Once for a whole body massage and the other for a facial( very basic). Both times the staff where polite and patient.. 	Best massage experience so far in my life. Highly recommend!! 	By far the best massage I've ever had in my life. My masseuse was Jen and she did an amazing job. Great value, attentive service, and high quality massage. Will definitely return 	The masseuse was polite and funny at the same time. They will offer you membership with unlimited time of usage of period with the deposit system. I forgot to take pics, the place was so relaxing. 	Very good Thai massage. Facility is large and clean. Staff is courteous. I will be back.

This was the absolute worst oil massage I‚Äôve ever had. No elbows, no proper stretching, no deep tissue, nothing. All the way up to the end where I was expecting a solid shoulder massage. Nope. Apparently my girlfriend had a good massage but she isn‚Äôt the one leaving a review. Not sure why they chose the weakest link to massage me, but on top of all that I was ticklish the ENTIRE time. Which has never happened in 15 years of massages a good place will not tickle you over and over to the point you‚Äôre uncomfortable. Ridiculous. 	Very good and professionel massage. Shop clean and airconditioned.  Nuad dee mak	One of the best massages I ever had in Thailand. Very clean place, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff :) would highly recommend to anyone! 	It was the best spa I have ever been..from the prices to the reception and specially the massage..all my tiredness from the flight was instantly gone with such a nice and professional massage..will definitely go again next week until I am in Thailand and recommend to everyone. 	Simple massage parlour with very friendly and experienced masseuses. My husband and I had excellent massages and will be back soon. Several massage options available for a range of durations.

I received a Thai Balm massage, my girlfriend a leg massage and my mother an oil massage... and all three of us agreed on the same thing: it was incredible!  The place is clean, quiet and very cozy. The masseuses are true professionals, with expert hands who know exactly how to relieve tension and take care of every detail. The Thai Balm massage was deep and revitalizing, ideal for unloading the entire body. My girlfriend was delighted with the work on her legs, and my mother floated away from the oil massage.  You can see that there is passion here for what they do. It is not just another massage place: it is a real wellness center. We will return without hesitation every time we are in the area.  A big thank you to the SUPAWADEE team for taking such good care of us. Totally recommended! 	The service is very good. The owner of the shop is cute. Good masseuse, spacious room, will definitely come back again. 	It's hard to beat a Thai massage in Bangkok, but I discovered this place by chance because I was staying near the airport and it was definitely my best discovery. I immersed myself in a two-hour massage along with a very delicate exfoliation that left me feeling like new. Without a doubt when I return I will repeat. Super recommended!! 	Felt like home, good service, spacious room, clean cloth, good masseuse, will definitely come back again. 	The room is very spacious, the reception is good, the masseuse is good, the linens are very clean.	The massage shop is clean, the masseuse is very good, I recommend it.

The massage felt like it was my first one in the great city of Bangkok. The masseuse was well experienced & gave a consent form to ensure customers were well taken care of.  Owner is a nice lady & her command of English is decent in a conversation.  Thank you & I hope to come again! 	Highly recommending. Tried Thai massage balm oil for 90 minutes. Very relaxing, peaceful and calm. Neatly maintained washrooms for bath with quality toiletries. They serve green tea at the end with savoury. Best for ladies travelling alone. 	Came for a 1h foot massage with my gf. The service we received was truly outstanding. They really do their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The massage covered all the right spots. The pressure was perfect. Hygiene is also top notch. I have been to countless massage places and this is easily in my top 3. 	The best massage in Thailand so far!!! It‚Äôs my 5th time in Thailand, went to many different massage places but never had such an experience. Coming back for sure and definitely recommend to you :)) 	While prices are same as in other places, this place looks more professional than average Bangkok massage parlour. 	Very good massage, friendly, cheap. I promptly after s great foot massage stayed for 1 hour body massage 	I fully recommend here. Almost all of staff can speak english a little bit. One of tip for you, here Boss is best therapist! And her english is enough good. But usually she very busy. If you are lucky then take a massage from her. Really, here is one of  best massage shop in Bangkok. And I think here is the best cost effectiveness place! 	A down to earth massage parlour.. been here a couple of times and never disappoints. Price is reasonable, and the therapists were good and experienced. Will definitely visit here again! 	Best massage I ever had - in the world - without reservation. Foot or full body, you cannot go wrong. I had the full body Thai Oil Massage 1 1/2 hours - TWICE in two days! üòÑ and also enjoyed a 1-hour foot massage.  The owner speaks enough English to understand and communicate clearly. The entire staff are very polite, efficient, and skilled. Prices are also very reasonable with the exchange rate from the US dollar‚Ä¶ around $21 (700 baht) with tip included. Highly recommend! 	We have the best experience of Thai Massage, herbal heating stone. Highly recommend this place. My muscle tension for many years have been relieved a lot and I feel much better with just 1 therapy. Feeling thankful. 	Its a small thai massage shop, where you can get an original thai massage from 200 bahts, like 6 euros for an hour of massage... Especcially search for Mrs. NUT, a little older but very expirience massus, and after an hour treatment, you will definetly feel much better üòÄüòÉ DEFINETLY RECOMENDED	Best Thai massage I have had on this trip. The shop is clean and we'll looked after. The staff were friendly and professional.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for a good massage in Bangkok.	First time i went there today.  The massage is very good.  They are very good people. Warm welcome i love it. The speak very good and lovely people  I enjoyed a lot the massage after massage feel light and good.  I will go again for sure because i enjoyed a lot  Thank you very much üôè had a very good time there ‚ù§Ô∏è	Very nice place, clean and professional. All of them are well trained, have good manners, and do a good job. I am happy to pay the little above average rate for this service! 	Very polite treatment and reasonable price.  It's clean and considerate.  Personally, I'm grateful for the Thai massage using oil and balm. 	Good massage provided here. (Currently away, will definitely be back! Most polite service!!)  Finally back in Bangkok. Done 2hrs Thai Oil Massage last night.. Thanks Jeab! 	Very friendly and professional staff, spoke English well. Great massage. 	Wow very great place for peaceful  massage .

Spend 1 hrs for Thai Massage and I would say above average.  Price is Reasonable and staff is friendly. Masseur skills is good too. If happened to be around the area, would come back again. 	Been in Thailand over 10 years. 100's massages. This shop was such a great find. P Earn is super talented. Very professional and friendly with a big üòÅ. She knows the body very well. Expect some pain in order to release the tension. Room was comfortable, not too cold and pleasant music. Highly recommend!! ‚Ä¶ 	I don't usually go for massages, but I have been feeling a lot of ache and pain in my shoulder muscle, so I decided to get a shoulder massage. I found this massage spa on Google Maps. After one hour of head, neck, and shoulder massage, I felt relieved of all the pain and muscle ache. The masseuse was professional and caring. A good massage place to visit around Udom Suk. 	The massage therapist is truly a skilled professional! It was very relaxing and comfortable. I love it! 	It was the least satisfying two-hour massage I've ever had. The shop has no sound isolation, so you constantly hear cars, motorcycles, and outside noise, making relaxation impossible. The massage itself was dull and unsatisfying‚ÄîI just lay there waiting for it to end. To top it off, I paid for two hours but only received 1 hour and 45 minutes. 	If you like waiting and end up not getting a massage come here. When we first booked our spot, the massage place said we had to wait around 40 minutes and confirmed our reservation. We went for dinner and returned 5 minutes early. The receptionist made us wait 15 minutes, before telling us it would take another 5 minutes for their staff to arrive. Once that 5 minutes passed, she told us that we would need to wait another 40 minutes because those staff had other customers that were more important than us. They clearly us differently because we were foreigners, and not as important as their local customers. 	Highly Recommended for people who wants to pamper their body and mind. very relaxing and affordable Spa. Keep it up! 	Very good massage! We dropped by completely spontaneously and we received an excellent treatment. People were friendly and they take credit card.  So big advantage here.  Greetings to the lady with the strong elbows!	Very bad experience. The masseur was very rude and kept interrupting my conversation with my friend. The masseur kept chatting during the process. During the massage, we kept asking the masseur to increase the intensity, but we did not get a response. The massage skills were poor. From the beginning to the end, I just felt as if the masseuse was just touching my body without pressing. It is very scary to let guests of the opposite sex directly enter the cubicle while naked, and the curtains cannot be completely closed. 	Had a good experience twice as someone not from thailand! Their massage is so nice! Staffs are very caring and friendly! 	Super good massage please and the massager is really professional. Good price and I have tried set B which 90mins spa in 990 baht which includes milk and body scrubs. 	Very happy with the massage , really relaxing. The staff is very highly experienced and good at their job. 	I did the medication one and I great experience, great service. The place is nice and clean. 	I did body and face massge while i reallt needed. Really relaxing and superb love the massage therpaist lady who did my face very well location is not so far as welllüíìüíØ ‚Ä¶	One of the best place to massage in bangkok thailand. You will feel pleasurable welcome and feel good massage. Try once when you are here in thailand. Don‚Äôt Miss !  Thank You Roma Massage & Spa 	The massage by crazy felt totally professional I was comfortable at all time. 	Amazing massage. They have loyalty cards so I will definitely come back until I can get my free massage ‚ú®üëç ‚Ä¶ 	Really enjoyable for a good massage. Been visiting for over a year when im in Bangkok. Highly recommend a visit when you are staying in the area! 	Found this gem of a place walking past the shop. I had the best massage had in a while. Also had a facial massage and cleanse, which was as good. I highly recommend Roma Massage Spa for anyone looking for good massage and a lovely clean space with amazing polite staff. Thank you ladies. 	Great place to have a massage in Thailand!! We had Thai Massage for 1 hr and the staffs were very professional and polite

The staff here are polite, attentive, and really care about every detail. The prices are very reasonable, and the massage was absolutely amazing üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I tried the 1-hour aromatherapy massage for 900 baht, and it was so relaxing ‚Äî it truly helped melt away all the stress. The atmosphere in the shop is very calming, clean, and cozy. I felt completely relaxed and even fell asleep during the session üòÇ  Free parking is available, but finding a spot can be a bit tricky during evening hours. If you‚Äôre coming after 5 PM, I recommend booking ahead and coming a little early. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind! 	Only have 2 rooms to do aroma massages if I‚Äôm not wrong. Tried body scrub and aroma massage, 2 hours. (45mins body scrub+15mins bath+1 hour aroma massage) When doing body scrub the air conditioner was very strong and the blanket is very thin. Which lead me to had goosebump the whole treatment. For the aroma (finally got thick blanket), the massage on foot was strong, and focus on massaging it, which is good and comfortable. But on the other hand makes massage on back and upper body part a bit perfunctory. The time of massaging each body part was not quite balance. 	The traditional Thai massage was amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxing with calming music, and the masseuse made sure to cater the massage to my specific needs. I felt so taken care of üòä thank you!! ‚Ä¶	Nice experience, I tried aroma massage (1.30hrs = 1,000Bht) it was relaxing, great massage place. Room was perfectly clean and soothing, good quality with a reasonable price. Lots of free parking in the shopping area.  Definitely come back again, Highly recommended. üòÅ 	Lovely little massage shop located in the back part of Little Walk Bangna. The massage therapist are professional and everything is very clean. I‚Äôve been here 5 or 6 times and will continue to come. The hot stone massage is highly recommended too. 	probably the best Thai massage I've ever experienced. The room is so clean and tranquil, and also it smells very refreshing. Massager is good and polite, I would for sure visit again. 	Best price quality massage service in Bangna area. Place is very clean and comfortable. Got different masseuse everytime I went and all of them were very highly skilled. Only drawback is that you have to book early. Very difficult to find slots on weekend. 	Good place, very professional, experienced ad friendly masseuses doing good massages. Bit hurting sometimes but they know how to do their jobs. Free hot tea afterwards. We booked a head & shoulder massage and 3 foot massages. The receptionist was very friendsly and flexible with the appointments. Even the foot massage had a finishing head & neck therapy. Recommended ‚úåÔ∏è 	Excellent massage place. Must book in advance, can't just walk in. Mostly it is full. Highly recommended 	Wide arrange of massages available, very different experience than massage parlors I have visited previously.  Kind and experienced staff. The lady at the front desk is also very warm and kind. Definitely recommend this place whilst at little walk bangna! üëê 	Very nice Thai Massage parlor.....I requested for a deep tissue massage and Ms.Tik was assigned for me....she was very professional & an expert in her job....I felt rejuvenated & completely relaxed.This is the 2nd time I took the services & will go again.Will recommend anytime. 	Seriously great massage. Clean and professional. A little more expensive than the average but well worth it. 	Excellent massage, very professional place, friendly staff. There are cheaper massages available in the area but probably won‚Äôt be as good as here. 	One of the best Thai massage I have experienced. Clean and professional service. Highly recommend. 	After looking at this place from thainakrin hospital room I had to treat myself to a thai and aromatherapy massages - both were awesome and girls are fabulous - ambiance  is delightful THANKS üòÉ ‚Ä¶ 	One of the best reflexology spa I have been!

The ambiance is comfortable, though the air conditioning can get a bit chilly if you‚Äôre sitting directly under it‚Äîdon‚Äôt hesitate to ask for a blanket if you feel cold.  The masseuses are skilled and provide a good foot massage, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of service. I haven‚Äôt tried their Thai massage yet, but based on my experience with the foot massage, I  had a good session.  One thing to note is that the place accepts cash only, so make sure to have some on hand. It‚Äôs also customary to tip the masseuse after the session, which is a nice way to show appreciation for their work.  Overall, Foot Massage Balsabai is a solid choice for a relaxing massage in the Sukhumvit area. I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone looking for a clean and professional massage experience. 	I haven't noticed this place before and I thought it was rather new, but it has been opened for quite some time. I was staying at the hotel opposite and I came across this place one night on my way back and decided to give it a try. There were quite a lot of people waiting but I didn't take long to get someone to serve me. Furnishing is quite modern and the massage chairs looks new and clean. I requested for a male masseur and got one and I was impressed with his skills and his pressure. As usual, there was washing of the feet before massage and tea was served after the massage. It is one of the most quiet place I have done a massage so far, seems like they refrain the customers and the staff from talking so the environment is very conducive. I would return and would also recommend this place to try foot massage. Price is slightly more expensive then the usual massage places but I guess it is worth it for the environment and the quality of the massage. It deserves more than a 4 stars, maybe a 4.5. 	Fresh off a flight and needed to relax. Great that they were open until midnight. On a fairly busy street. The price was reasonable and it was a very clean and modern environment. Looked like a very new establishment. I asked for a strong masseuse because I like it strong. Thought it was a great and relaxing. 	Simple, clean and no frills foot massage. I appreciate how focused the massage was and enjoyed the 1hr session with my male masseuse. Paid 399baht. 	It‚Äôs good, clean place and lots of sofas available but it‚Äôs like double the price of most foot massages in BKK. I recon it‚Äôs beside Marriott so it‚Äôs all tourists 	I have forced myself to provide a 5 star review for this business because it was really 5 star service. The foot massage was so relaxing that I fell asleep during my 30 min massage. It was very therapeutic and satisfying after a long day of exploring Bangkok and my legs were numb and hurting. The staff were so polite and caring, they wash your feet well before starting the treatment. They are located at a prime location right outside Marriott. I highly recommend this business to anyone traveling into Bangkok. 	This is one of the few green spas on this street, and the massage therapists are genuinely hardworking. But is there a downside? Absolutely and it‚Äôs a major one. The overweight woman at the front desk is unbelievably rude and lacks basic manners, enough to ruin your entire experience here. 	highly recommended massage after a tiring day. I opted for foot massage for an hour and it was truly relaxing. I was embarrassed to sleep twice during the massage as it was so relaxing. They offer green tea after the massage. 	This place has a good price for a 1 hour massage, is focused on foot massages so the masseuses are all trained for that, and has comfy chairs. Easy for a quick in and out! Good location if you‚Äôre staying at the hotels nearby. 	Went here multiple times and always got a great foot massage! They make sure you‚Äôre comfortable and offer a great service, also late in the evening! 	Best place. So calm, relaxing place with good music. We loved the massage from the start to finish. Best place we have been to so far. Reasonable prices; 10.5‚Ç¨ We really recommend it! 	Not sure why they don't accept the online booking? I was call trying to get a booking beforehand but they rejected. Have been told Only for walk-in...I have been so many massage places, such a Health land, let's relax and many places. They all accept online booking. What a regret. 	Excellent foot massage experience! Skilled therapist, calming ambiance, and great value. Highly recommended 	If you're staying across from the Marriott, this is the massage parlour with the best business! The parlour's facade is entirely made of glass and you can see it's virtually full all the time. Foot massages get topped up with a top body massage. Look for Joe... He's the best! I discovered bones in my body I never knew I had üòÇ ‚Ä¶ 	Clean, quiet, professional and reasonably priced. Better than most other ones on the street which appear more dodgy. Lovely staff. They only do foot massage. May feel a bit industrial but it‚Äôs not. And they all have the same technique so you can tell they‚Äôve had training. I recommend 	Popular foot massage by tourists, good location next to metro station & several hotels, clean massage chair, friendly staff, professional massage, slightly pricey than other nearby massage shops. 	I was looking for a place that would offer a good strong memorable foot massage is a nice clean atmosphere. I found it here. Easy to get to. The staff were attentive, the chairs were comfortable and the atmosphere lovely. The women who worked on my feet for 90 min did an outstanding job. If you are here on vacation and need a foot massage, I highly recommend this shop.	We were fooled by the nice decor. Weak foot massages with lots of flowing movements but barely any pressure. Both my wife and I experienced the same. Never again. 	I took 30-minutes foot massage and it was great. Very nice staff, comfortable chairs and calm music. I will be back for sure. 	This is a great Foot Massage establishment. Not intimidating to enter as there are no aggressive sales ladies out front. This place was packed when I was there and yet quiet enough to get everyone being treated nice and relaxed.  Great price and friendly staff.  Will be going back before I leave this land of smiles.

Owner was very kind and staff were really good at what they were doing. I would highly recommend this place which you can find once you step out of Udomsuk BTS. It was a repeat visit for me as the foot & Head , shoulder and back massage was very much relaxing. Totally worth a visit. 	Highly recommend this shop for your foot massage. I‚Äôve tried some places but this shop is the best, they know how to relax your muscles and release pains 	I rang ahead and booked an appointment for 2x foot massages. When we arrived, the man behind the desk said I ‚Äúcannot have a foot massage, I will not fit in the chair‚Äù because I ‚Äúam big‚Äù. He went on to say if I sit in his chair, ‚Äúthe chair will be broken.‚Äù Good people of google, I do have a big butt. But given I have never broken a chair in my life, buy all my clothes at a regular store and could have easily fit in the chair I think these comments were unwarranted. TWO female Thai massage staff apologised to me on behalf of the boss; they were clearly embarrassed. I was with my 8 year old son so I ended up getting an oil massage which was excellent so the stars are purely for the rude boss. Photo of my butt for reference 	My back has been in a lot of pain, sleeping, and everyday movements have been painful. I went to this massage parlour, and I'm so glad I chose this one. I've had many massages in bangkok. This has to be one of, if not the best I've had. Sometimes I ask for something, and i don't get it. Here, she took the time to focus on my problem areas and skipped the ares that needed less attention. This meant I got much better value for my hour. My therapist was called Moxie or something similar. I believe that she was only 21. I usually go for old therapists because I think they have more experience, well she's proven me wrong. I'm so impressed. I will be living in bangkok, so I will make sure I return many times. I was served tea at the end, which tasted lovely. Also, you know it's professional when they wash your feet first and give you clothing to put on. Many places do this, but some do not. If you keep the clothes on that you entered with, expect a less professional massage. 	I have extensive experience with massages, and I can confidently say that ‚ÄúNa Siam Massage‚Äù is the best massage parlor in Bangkok. I lived in the city for almost a year and visited this salon nearly every day. The prices are very reasonable, and the selection of masseuses is impressive. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, and their professional skills are top-notch. The salon operates on a queue system, but you always have the option to choose your own masseuse. I usually booked my sessions in advance, although it probably wasn‚Äôt necessary since there was always a free masseuse available. Throughout my visits, I encountered both seasoned professionals and newcomers to the trade, and each session was enjoyable in its own way. The boss is a true heart of the establishment, always greeting with a smile. However, the real star of the salon is Dr. Ton. I met him at another salon and always chose him for my massages. When he moved to ‚ÄúNa Siam Massage,‚Äù I followed, and I have no regrets. Besides massages, I also tried the body scrub, and it was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend this salon to everyone. When I‚Äôm back in Bangkok, this will be the first place I visit. 	Very bad. I rarely criticise massage service and this is my first time rating a thai massage. Speechless.  I need to go back to p's thai massage or thanomchaiaree massage for the best experience 	First time was quite okay , but my second visit I decided to go for 2 hours and I not just ended up paying more than agreed in the beginning, but also with a way too painful massage. I couldn‚Äôt relax once within 2 hours and told the lady more than 5 times to be softer. She seemed to understand but would always go back to it. Left the place in pain and turning my head to even look somewhere is painful. I rarely write reviews because massages are great everywhere in Thailand, but id warn someone out there one unless you like it harder than the Thai average. 	Went twice in a week.  I had neck back massage for 300 baht.  Asked for a guy and he pressed very hard, will go again. 	I have been here more than 5 times. Only first time was fine . And rest of times, I was hesitant to give tips as did't satisfied. Most of young massager should have better skill more. 	Love it, this is the first foot massage place in Thailand that focus on the foot. I love it, I did not get the name of the young lady but, she was wonderful, thank you. I would go back here every day 	I went here because of the high rating but was not impressed. It was one of the most painful experiences that I went through, getting a head and shoulder massage. Some people may be into the deep, painful massage but it left me very stiff and I could feel my upper back was swollen for the next couple of days.  I ended up going over to So Relax Massage on the other side of the BTS Station for the remainder of my massages. They were much more in tune with my individual preference of the type of massage I like. 	decent skill, communication and price. popular among locals. independent room provided for full body massage. strong woman massage personnel available. Ask for the full body oil massage not only foot, the service definitely worths the price! 	Was really looking forward to this place because of all the five star reviews. Unfortunately I got the worst foot massage and I ended up canceling the other massage I was going to do. It really depends on who you get as a masseuse I suppose because the girl assigned to me seemed very inexperienced and I felt like I just paid to have her touch my feet not give a massage. The two other people giving a massage next to me seemed better at their jobs. I tried to communicate via Google translate but there's really not much you can say when the problem is lack of experience. I told the guy at the desk I was disappointed by the massage and he said sorry but was completely unfazed. Perhaps it's because I'm a foreigner so he didn't care? It was seriously a waste of money. I think there are much better places with better customer service at the same price. 	Was really looking forward to this place because of all the five star reviews.

I think there are much better places with better customer service at the same price. 	Today I went here for a "Neck, Shoulder & Back massage". I absolutely loved it! I like the massage hard, and the masseur provided it with his strong fingers and elbows. My scapulas were full of knots and he did a very good job. He used some menthol ointment (like Bengay) that also warms up the muscles. After the massage they served a cup of warm tea. Definitely would visit here again. It is a clean place. But let me warn you, if you don't like the hard stuff just go with the classic mild Thai massage. By the way, I paid 300 baht for an hour of massage which is a very good deal (I also tipped the masseur).	Probably the best foot massage I've gotten in Bangkok and you can't beat the price. I was served by this older lady and she knew what she's doing and hit all the right spots. Definitely will return the next time I'm there. 	Excellent foot massage for 200 baht in a friendly and clean environment. The fianc√©e got the Thai massage (also 200 baht) and loved it, even though it was one of the most firm ones she's had. Great service and value, plus steps from Udom Suk BTS! 	I used to go there sometimes because I live nearby, but I don't anymore. There is a big difference in the skill of the staff. The bad staef is that they cut corners. 	I visited here several times during my stay in Bangkok in Dec '16 because I stayed at a condo nearby and again in March/April '17.  I received excellent service each time and I highly recommend anyone who likes to get a professional Thai massage to visit Na Siam. 	Good massage in town  near BTS. Udomsuk exit 4.

Masseuses are quite skillful. PS. If you buy a package deal, you save about 10% (I did.) 	Overall, a good experience.  Told my masseuse (with the help of my wife) to go easy on me with a neck and shoulder massage and she did quite well.  Probably one of the few massages I‚Äôve ever gotten where the service lasted the entire hour. My only gripe is the outside noise from the traffic (I know, there‚Äôs not much they can do), and my masseuse had a couple words with the other masseuse next door during my massage.  She was very kind beyond that. 	Good massage. Masseuse actually responded when I asked for more pressure.  A bit pricey for the area, 400 baht 1 hour heand and neck massage.  Facilities are clean.  There was an off duty masseuse in the next space who was texting texting texting with super loud notifications on. Super annoying.	Good professional massage. They have shower available, they provide pants for patrons, they provide tea, all that small things. Apparently locals go there too (overheard one talking on the phone next to me) Positive Professionalism	Recommend to get a foot massage by Khun Mam. She is a part-time masseuse but very good. You can book for her on the weekends. 	Very good service and relaxing massage. The ladies know well about the massage techniques. Thanks a lot for a wonderful Thai massage. 	Authentic Thai massage with soothing and relaxing environment! A good place for you to relax your soul for couple of hours ! 	The place to be! Always a highlight for me to relax. 	The lady was doing her job just horrible, painful and uncomfortable I hated it and just left. But my friend was ok. 	Very nice real thai massage, nice place expert staff affordable price, athrapist name miss wa is very expert and professional. 	Always have a good experience here. Quality massages and very professional. 	Best massage on the area by far! 	‚ÄúMassage is good to the strands. The massage was very satisfying.‚Äù Before going, it is recommended to make a reservation and inform us what type of massage you want: light/heavy. Each person's experience is different. The doctor I booked and massaged today requested a 2 hour intensive massage. Royal style, thumb press, strong and precise lines. When stepping on the legs, it was hard at the point, didn't hit the bones, and the force was stable for 2 hours. Bael fruit juice is delicious. I've studied massage and only when the doctor holds the first line will I know if I'm good at massaging or not. I'll stop by and go back for another massage. The price is suitable for the quality.	Bad massage, focusing on force, not hitting the tendons, massaging the neck, shoulders, the doctor told me to lie face down for 1 hour, did not change positions until my arm hurt. When I moved my arm because it hurt, he pushed it back to the original position with his hand and complained not to be afraid. When I told him that my arm hurt, he said that he was afraid himself, it must hurt anyway. Does the doctor really not know if the muscles are afraid or tense? I like massages a lot, but I have never met any shop that massages with force. In the end, when I got home, my neck was still tense, and my arm hurt too.  Some people are lucky to get a good doctor, but my girlfriend was unlucky. They should maintain the standard because the price is not cheap.  I want to give 0 stars but I didn't.  What a waste of money. A massage for 2 people costs 1,500 baht. It's not worth it. The name should be changed to Feel Bad Thai massage.  If you want to come to this shop, I recommend getting a massage at a coin-operated massage chair instead. 	The price is reasonable, they are friendly, and the massage is good. I recommend it as the parking facility is also good!!	The first massage was very good. The second time I got a massage, I didn't really hit the right spot, and the staff gossiped about customers who just left the shop... 	It's been a while since I've gone to get a massage, but here all the masseuses are very skilled. 	Good massage, but the area may be a little small. Minus 1 star because the masseuse likes to talk to each other often. 	I personally like it. Good massage, strong but not painful. The shop is clean, fragrant, quiet, good service, polite. There is a zone divided into massage rooms. clear foot massage	Clean, good masseuse, 2 hours worth the price.
