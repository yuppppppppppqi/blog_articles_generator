Amazing value for money! I would definitely recommend!	2 stars because I feel horrible for the lady that massaged me. When I walked in she went straight from massaging one lady  straight to me without washing her hands which grossed me out so bad but she was so sweet I didn’t want to say …	The massage is not professional. It’s like paying others to touch your leg only. They didn’t use any energy. Too overrated. Won’t visit again.	I had a fantastic massage here for such a valuable price. I was told the masseuse was the best in Krabi and I was not disappointed. Highly recommend	Pleasant atmosphere  good surroundings. Personally  I was (foot massage)  just stroked. No effort  no massage movements  just hands running along the leg. Feet were practically forgotten. But my wife was insanely delighted  although it is difficult to please her.
