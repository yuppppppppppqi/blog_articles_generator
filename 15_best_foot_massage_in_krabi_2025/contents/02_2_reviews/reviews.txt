The <strong><u>couples special was an amazing experience</u></strong>! Place was immaculate, staff outstanding.
One of the <strong><u>best Thai massages ever</u></strong> - deeply relaxing and truly therapeutic.
Came back every night of our trip! <strong><u>Absolutely amazing massages</u></strong> in a clean venue.
The full body oil massage was <strong><u>truly exceptional</u></strong>, relaxing and expertly done.
<strong><u>Excellent value for money</u></strong>, we came back two days in a row. Very skilled masseuses.
Receptionist <strong><u>Kew</u></strong> was incredibly knowledgeable and recommended the perfect massage for my pains.
An <strong><u>incredible authentic Thai massage</u></strong> with lovely staff and great prices. Highly recommended.
It was the <strong><u>best spa in Krabi</u></strong>! We had massages three days in a row, so impressive.
For the high price, I expected more of a spa atmosphere; rooms looked quite basic.
The noise from the street was a bit distracting during the massage.
