Had the <strong><u>most amazing traditional and foot massage</u></strong>! Staff are lovely and welcoming.
This was genuinely the <strong><u>best massage I had in Thailand</u></strong>, so relaxing and professional.
Visited several times, it became my special place to relax. <strong><u>Excellent service</u></strong>!
My therapist <strong><u>Al Ta</u></strong> was excellent! Highly recommend this place for a great massage.
The <strong><u>outdoor foot massage</u></strong> amidst greenery was a unique and wonderful experience.
<strong><u>Mon, Tuk, and Pop</u></strong> were all great therapists! Awesome pressure and very accessible location.
Felt <strong><u>extremely relaxed</u></strong> after the Office Syndrome package, my body felt more free.
<strong><u>Amazing service</u></strong> from beginning to end, the body scrub and massage were the best ever.
The pressure was a bit too light for my liking, but the atmosphere was nice.
It was good, but maybe not quite worth the little extra walk off the main road.
