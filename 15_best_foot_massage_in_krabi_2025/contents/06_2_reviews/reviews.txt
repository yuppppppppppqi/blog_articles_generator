This was the <strong><u>best Thai Massage I have had</u></strong>. Very professional & highly skilled.
A <strong><u>hidden gem in Krabi</u></strong>! Tried many places, this is one of the best. 10/10!
Masseur <strong><u>Korn</u></strong> did a great job untying knots on my shoulder/back. Felt relaxed.
<strong><u>Great experience</u></strong>! Super fair prices, clean place, friendly and professional staff.
<strong><u>Best foot massage ever</u></strong>! Highly recommend <strong><u>Kom</u></strong> if your feet are tired. Awesome!
Shockingly the <strong><u>best massage</u></strong> of my trip! Hit all the right pressure points.
<strong><u>Great and effective massage</u></strong>. Therapists were strong and knew the right places to press.
Felt really great after the massage. <strong><u>Professional and highly skilled</u></strong> staff. Will be back.
Staff seemed a bit rude during my afternoon visit, preferred the evening atmosphere.
The atmosphere is lacking, no music and minimal AC. Not the most comfortable setting.
