Very nice spot for a manipedi! <strong><u>Sai</u></strong> was super dedicated, precise, and gentle.

Had my nails done by <strong><u>Faith and Sai</u></strong>, really happy with the result! Returned again.
Had a <strong><u>fantastic experience with Ploy</u></strong>! Incredibly kind, professional, skilled, precise nails.

Went spontaneously, got manicure, head massage, sunburn treatment. <strong><u>More than satisfied</u></strong>!
Lovely, clean, professional place. Staff speak good English. Offer <strong><u>nails and massages</u></strong>.
Foot massage price varied based on pressure, which felt a bit unexpected.
My head/back massage was great, but the foot massage the next day was disappointing.
