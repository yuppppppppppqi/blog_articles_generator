<strong><u>Most amazing experience</u></strong>! The 3-hour package flew by, felt so relaxed afterwards.
Had a <strong><u>wonderful morning</u></strong> getting massages and nails done. Felt very happy!
<strong><u>Free pickup/dropoff</u></strong> was prompt and friendly. Lovely spa, great welcome drink.
<strong><u>Brazilian wax was great</u></strong>, technician friendly and efficient. Clean, pretty salon.
Incredibly relaxing massage, <strong><u>great professionalism</u></strong>. Beautiful, clean place, felt well cared for.
<strong><u>Amazing massage</u></strong>! They really listened about pressure and tight spots. Great prices.
One of the <strong><u>best massages I've had</u></strong>. Excellent, friendly service from this family business.
<strong><u>Outstanding service</u></strong> from reception and therapist. Very neat, clean, reasonable price.
Wish I had opted for 90 minutes instead of 60, the massage was expertly delivered.
The prices seemed fair, but maybe slightly higher than other places nearby.
