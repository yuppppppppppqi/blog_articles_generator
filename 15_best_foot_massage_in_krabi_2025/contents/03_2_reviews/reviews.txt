One of the <strong><u>best massages I've ever had</u></strong>! Clean, peaceful, staff super professional.
Very <strong><u>professionally done massage</u></strong>, the parlor was very soothing and clean.
Everything you need: weed, clothes, and <strong><u>great Thai massage</u></strong>. The owner is nice.
Lovely staff, very clean salon, and <strong><u>great pressure</u></strong>. Amazing value for money!
<strong><u>Felt comfortable and reassured</u></strong> by the professional and lovely group. Highly recommend.
<strong><u>Fantastic massage</u></strong> for such a valuable price. Masseuse was the best in Krabi!
Good massage, the person guiding us spoke English well and was <strong><u>helpful</u></strong>.
Clean, peaceful, relaxing place. Staff were <strong><u>super professional and welcoming</u></strong>. Felt refreshed.
My foot massage felt more like stroking, not much effort or focus on feet.
The therapist didn't wash hands between clients, which felt a bit off.
