<strong><u>Great massage, reasonable prices</u></strong> in central Ao Nang. Owners friendly and welcoming.
My fav spot! <strong><u>P' Pan</u></strong> is my favorite therapist, always does a good job.
Never gone anywhere else after finding this place! <strong><u>Ping</u></strong> gave great massages.
<strong><u>Very good massage</u></strong>, better quality than many fancy, expensive salons nearby.
<strong><u>Nice atmosphere</u></strong>, clean and aromatic. Professional massagers with strength. Open late.
<strong><u>Great coconut oil massage</u></strong>, probably the best we had in Thailand. Good prices!
Nice and <strong><u>very affordable</u></strong> massage place, the lady was experienced and strong.
Happy hour deal was a nice bonus. <strong><u>Friendly staff</u></strong> and good prices.
Foot massage pressure was far too much, even after asking for softer. Woke up in pain.
Felt awkward with the curtain slightly open during stretches. Painful at times.
