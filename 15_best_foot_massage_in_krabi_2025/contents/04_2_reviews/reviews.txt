<strong><u>Highly recommend!</u></strong> Very professional and clean. Came back two nights in a row.
Back, shoulders, head massage was great, even stretched me a bit. <strong><u>Calming atmosphere</u></strong>.
My wife and I were <strong><u>completely satisfied and relaxed</u></strong> after our massages. No complaints!
Shout out to <strong><u>Box</u></strong> for the amazing foot massage work and great attentiveness!
Finally a <strong><u>nice strong massage</u></strong> in Thailand! Ben was fantastic, great foot/back combo.
Pu is definitely the <strong><u>best in town</u></strong>, even better than my resort spa. Impeccable service.
We came twice! <strong><u>Affordable, clean</u></strong>, with many beds separated by curtains. Good place.
<strong><u>Completely satisfied and relaxed</u></strong> after traditional Thai massage with hot oil. Good price.
The reflexology was decent, but mostly legs below the knee, not focused foot work.
Massage technique felt off, atmosphere was noisy in the basement. Stopped halfway.
