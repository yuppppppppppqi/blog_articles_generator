<strong><u>Jin</u></strong> gave a phenomenal back massage, very thorough and used a <strong><u>great balm</u></strong>!
Absolutely the <strong><u>best Thai massage</u></strong> I've had, therapist focused skillfully on my problem areas.
Such <strong><u>precious and sweet ladies</u></strong> work here! Good massage for an unbeatable price, plus yummy tea.
One of the <strong><u>best massages</u></strong> in 12 years of visiting Thailand. Will definitely return!
The therapists clearly know their stuff, <strong><u>finding and fixing problems</u></strong>. Humble place, excellent massage.
Best massage in 5 months in Thailand! <strong><u>Very professional and kind</u></strong> people. The tea was amazing too.
Didn't expect much, but left thinking it was one of the <strong><u>best massages ever</u></strong>. Wow!
Felt like heaven here! They know the trigger points, <strong><u>great energy</u></strong>, kind staff, and good tea.
The massage was okay, but the room felt a bit cramped and noisy sometimes.
It was a decent massage, but didn't quite hit the deep spots I was hoping for.
