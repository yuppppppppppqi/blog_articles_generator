Recommend <strong><u>"Day" for a two-hour Thai massage</u></strong>! She was amazing, knew exactly what I needed.
Excellent massage, <strong><u>knowledgeable and professional staff</u></strong>. Knew where extra work was needed. Best in Thailand!
<strong><u>Very clean place</u></strong>, professional massage. Amazing and pleasant every time. Nice smell, polite masters, relaxing tea.
Very good massage in central Koh Phangan. <strong><u>Relaxed vibe</u></strong>, they take good care of you. Recommend!
One of the <strong><u>best massages on the island</u></strong>! Relaxing Thai massage, but they offer firmer options too.
<strong><u>Exceptional quality massage</u></strong>! Therapist was incredibly skilled and attentive. Excellent customer service, felt welcomed.
Amazing Massage â€“ Highly Recommended! Had an <strong><u>incredible massage experience</u></strong> here, top-notch place!
Appreciated the receptionist informing me about the type of Thai massage. <strong><u>Good communication and service</u></strong>.
The 'private massage' sign is misleading, you still share the room with others which wasn't ideal.
The experience felt rushed today, put in a room with someone else already mid-massage. Disappointing.
