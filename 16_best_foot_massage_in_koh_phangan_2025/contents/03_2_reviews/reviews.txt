Hands down the <strong><u>best massage place</u></strong> in Koh Phangan! Therapists are professional and precise.
<strong><u>Tum</u></strong> was exceptionally pleasant for Thai and oil massages during my three-week stay. Highly trusted!
Found this place again after years! Still the <strong><u>best massage experience</u></strong> compared to many others.
As a therapist, this is the <strong><u>best massage I've had in Thailand</u></strong>. Bella found all tension areas!
Kind and <strong><u>super professional staff</u></strong>. Cozy place with tea and fruit afterwards. Aloe Vera massage recommended.
Came twice, <strong><u>With was the best masseur</u></strong> ever! Worked magic on my tense back and shoulders.
<strong><u>Som Si</u></strong> gave the best Facelift Massage, found all triggers in my face, jar, and neck. Amazing!
Best back-neck-shoulder massage on the island! Felt so good afterward, <strong><u>highly recommend</u></strong> from my heart.
The foot massage was the most painful I've ever had, felt zero relaxation unfortunately.
Quality seems to have weakened recently, lots of therapist turnover and inconsistent pressure sometimes.
