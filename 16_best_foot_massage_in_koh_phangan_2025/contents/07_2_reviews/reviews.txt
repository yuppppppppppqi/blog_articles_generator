Had a <strong><u>great 1-hour foot massage</u></strong>, perfect pressure, not too strong. Really relaxed, almost fell asleep!
One of the <strong><u>best Thai massages in Thailand</u></strong>! Deeply relaxing yet strong and effective. Precision technique.
<strong><u>Wow! Amazing massage from Pon</u></strong>. She found exact spots no one else did, true pain relief expert!
Incredible massage, felt amazing afterwards. <strong><u>Exactly the right balance</u></strong> between strong and soft. Lovely team!
Really good place, <strong><u>masseuses are quite skilled</u></strong>. Calm atmosphere, definitely recommended for a quality massage.
<strong><u>Best massage shop on the island</u></strong>! Been coming back since last year. 20/10 would recommend.
One of the best massages ever! <strong><u>Perfect pressure</u></strong>, focused on tense spots. Will visit again if back!
Had massages here daily, even expats frequent this place. <strong><u>Consistently great quality</u></strong> and service. Thank you!
Visited a few times, but the quality was disappointing again this time. Won't be returning.
The waiting area is comfortable, but sometimes the tea offered after isn't very hot.
