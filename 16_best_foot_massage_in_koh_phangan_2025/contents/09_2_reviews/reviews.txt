Absolutely perfect, <strong><u>one of the best massages ever</u></strong>! Relaxing yet therapeutically precise. Warm atmosphere.
Amazing place! Fixed my shoulder/thigh pain after a trip. <strong><u>Reduced pain by 90%</u></strong>. Kind staff.
Really good massage! Perfect pressure for Thai massage, not too hard. Boyfriend liked his oil massage too.
Tried Thai and oil massage, absolutely delighted! <strong><u>Perfectly relieved tension</u></strong> while providing deep relaxation.
<strong><u>Therapist Mo was amazing</u></strong> for shoulder/back! Didn't hurt but hit spots perfectly. Great technique.
Lovely people, great massages! Came back 4 times. <strong><u>Really kind, good massage</u></strong>. Quiet, relaxing place.
<strong><u>Owner View is very kind and super skilled</u></strong>. Proper strong but not painful massage, hit exact spots!
Great oil massage! Relaxing with just the right pressure. <strong><u>Liked it a lot</u></strong> compared to others.
The chairs were a bit uncomfortable for the foot massage duration, could be improved.
It was good, but maybe a bit too strong for my personal preference sometimes.
