・Conveniently located right in Thong Sala, Pure Relax offers a <strong><u>professional and skilled massage experience</u></strong>. Therapist "Day" comes highly recommended, particularly if you're looking for a thorough two-hour Thai massage. The staff generally are noted for being knowledgeable and attentive, seeming to have a knack for knowing where you need extra focus. They also offer sports massages if you prefer firmer pressure. The environment is clean with a pleasant aroma, and you get a relaxing hot tea afterwards, which is a nice touch. Their honesty was highlighted when they returned a lost phone. It's a solid choice for a Thai or sports massage downtown, though be aware some recent feedback mentioned shared rooms impacting privacy somewhat.
