<strong><u>Welcoming, positive, peaceful atmosphere</u></strong>. Amazing Foot & Shoulder massage, perfect pressure, felt super relaxed.
Masseuses are <strong><u>stronger and more attentive</u></strong> than other places. A great place for relaxing massage.
<strong><u>Best massage in Phangan</u></strong> so far! Lovely owner and masseuse, great energy, felt light afterwards.
Super clean place with <strong><u>excellent, well-trained staff</u></strong>. Always polite, never disappointed. Highly recommend Sao!
Best massage in Thailand! Went four days in a row, it was <strong><u>superb every time</u></strong>.
<strong><u>Best foot massage ever</u></strong>! Sauo has a gift in her hands. Truly thankful for the experience.
Amazing massage, very relaxing and professional. Face scrub and neck/foot massage felt really good. <strong><u>Great value</u></strong>!
Fantastic experience! Staff are <strong><u>true professionals</u></strong>, exceptionally friendly, and speak English well. Relaxing place.
Wish they had more private rooms, sometimes you can hear others during the massage.
The waiting area is small, can get a bit busy during peak times.
