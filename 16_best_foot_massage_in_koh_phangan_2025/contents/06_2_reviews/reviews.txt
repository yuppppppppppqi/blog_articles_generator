<strong><u>Incredible experience</u></strong>! Practitioners are highly skilled, professional, and dedicated. Helped address my specific issues.
<strong><u>Best massage salon</u></strong> on the island, been coming for 3 years. Always great, friends loved it too!
Come here often, always like the massage and spa. <strong><u>Book in advance</u></strong> during high season!
Highly recommend! Travel from Samui for massages here. <strong><u>So relaxing, clean, friendly staff</u></strong>. Spa package amazing.
<strong><u>JJ was very good</u></strong> for Thai Oil Massage. Mixed oil with tiger balm, felt great afterwards.
Excellent salon, convenient location, parking available. <strong><u>Professional staff and loyal prices</u></strong>. Quality 5+.
Oil and Thai massages were really good here. Felt much better after visiting multiple times.
One of the best massages! Staff are <strong><u>amazing and well experienced</u></strong>. They did a great job.
Worst experience ever, staff was extremely rude and made false accusations about something minor.
Just got oil "applied", not massaged. Didn't help my sore legs at all, very disappointing foot massage.
