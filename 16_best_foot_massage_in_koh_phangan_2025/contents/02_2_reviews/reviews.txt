The staff here have <strong><u>great hand power</u></strong>, best fatigue relief I've had in Thailand!
<strong><u>Super service and massage</u></strong>! Book ahead, they get busy. Definitely recommended for Thai massage.
Very relaxing massage from <strong><u>professional and friendly ladies</u></strong>. Felt like hours of sleep!
My favorite place! Came many times, <strong><u>always good quality</u></strong> massages. Clean place, relaxing music.
<strong><u>Beautifully designed place</u></strong> with high quality. Well located and a wonderful experience overall.
One of the best on the island. <strong><u>Great service, skilled staff</u></strong>. Oil massage and Thai with balm recommended.
The coconut oil massage was amazing, <strong><u>gentle yet effective technique</u></strong>. Highly recommend!
Felt like a newborn after the 2hr Thai Oil/Balm massage. <strong><u>Found all the sweet spots</u></strong>!
Sometimes the massage quality varies, feels like a bit of a roulette depending on the therapist.
My foot massage felt weird today, the therapist seemed distracted for a good portion of it.
