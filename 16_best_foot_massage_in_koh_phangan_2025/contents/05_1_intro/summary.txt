・Rating: 4.8
・Price: Standard/Affordable (mentioned as "not expensive")
・Recommended: Guests seeking a <strong><u>strong yet deeply relaxing</u></strong> massage in a calm, clean setting. Particularly good for foot/shoulder work and as a preferred alternative to Pure Relax for some due to stronger pressure.
・Boonma Health Massage creates a wonderfully <strong><u>welcoming, positive, and peaceful atmosphere</u></strong> perfect for unwinding. Masseuses like Sao are known for being both strong and attentive, applying just the right pressure to induce deep relaxation while effectively working out tension. They receive high praise for their foot and shoulder massages, making it a go-to spot if those are your areas of focus. The salon is noted for its cleanliness and well-trained, professional staff, with relaxing tea offered post-treatment. For those who find some other places a bit too gentle, Boonma provides a <strong><u>satisfyingly strong</u></strong> yet still deeply relaxing alternative. They also offer other spa services like scrubs and waxing, all at affordable prices.
