But when I arrived around 4:30 PM, I was told I had to leave by 6 PM because a male housekeeper was scheduled to clean the female onsen area for a private guest booking.  This was not only uncomfortable, but also unfair. As a paying public guest, I was rushed out simply because a private client was given priority‚Äîeven though this is supposed to be a public onsen. The staff admitted this happens when private rooms are full, and they shift those guests into the public space instead.  It felt discriminatory and badly managed. To make things worse, it was pouring rain and I was left waiting with no transport. I came for relaxation and left feeling dismissed. I hope Yumoto reconsiders how it treats its public customers. 	I only tried the public onsen, so I can not speak to the other treatments. I got there shortly after it opened, so I had it to myself.  I found it relaxing. The hot pool was 40 C, and the cold pool was 14 C. The sauna was also quite hot but in a good way. 	Entry: 750TH All worth it in my opinion. Yes you can find cheaper ü´£ü§£ Etiquette: Bucknaked Towels: Yes Water: Yes lemon zest flavour üôèüèΩ Sandals: Yes Sauna: Yes Steam: Yes Hot / Cold bath: Yes	Lovely spa with a peaceful and relaxing ambience. I had an aromatherapy massage which was perfect. A nice choice of three scents for the massage. The onsen and sauna area was very relaxing. It is a public onsen but i was very lucky to have it to myself.	Yumoto Spa is very very good. The environment is perfect, new ,clean, cozy. For men there‚Äôs a big hot water pool and a medium cold water pool. And also have a big sauna room. And the price is also reasonable.  Worth it. 	Very clean, with welcoming staff. Complimentary welcome drinks, tea, and fruit were provided. After the service, everything was handled perfectly. 	Recommend onsen spa üßñ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I really enjoy and. Service is excellent üëç. Thank goodness ‚Ä¶ 	We had a great experience at Yumoto Onsen. The facility was super clean and hygienic. The staff was very friendly and attentive, anticipating every detail to ensure a relaxing visit. The massage was highly professional and customized to what you wanted. Even on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn‚Äôt crowded, allowing us to fully enjoy the serene ambiance. As a fun touch, the restrooms feature modern Japanese toilets! Overall, it was an amazing, refreshing, and truly zen experience. 	Very nice place, but onsen means natural water from ground. I lived in Japan 8 years, so O know the difference. The ambience is nice though. 	In the heart of chaotic Bangkok, Yumoto Spa & Wellness is a calm, clean and peaceful refuge. The staff are incredibly kind and the service is top-notch. I‚Äôve been here several times and I‚Äôll definitely be back. Highly recommended! 	the hot tub was 37.5c and extra shallow you cant really relax in there, the sauna was 65c, do thai have a different perception of hot tub sauna to the rest of the world? After reflecting to the manager, he arranged someone to turn up the temperature, they did turn up the sauna to 80, but something changed for the onsen. Dont call yourself a onsen/hotspring when the hotel bathtub is hotter than yours. 	Nice space, went on a Friday evening and had it to myself. It has a hot bath, a cold bath (extra cold) and a sauna, kind of like a sento. The price is a little high for just this, but it would be a nice add-on if you visit the spa. They should get rid of the wooden stools in the shower and just use plastic. 	Amazing place. So many amenities, very clean. Staff was very helpful in guiding a first timer. 	This place is very cozy. The massage is really good. for the onsen if you like private in weekday, I recommend because the people is not crowded. 	Part of the ‚ÄúTribe Living Bangkok Sukhumvit 39‚Äù hotel. Non-hotel guests are of course very welcome. 	Best place to spend the day to recharge. The sauna, the steam room, all of the pools are all so lovely and the facility is spotless 	Best 4 hand massage i ever had!!! 	Glad to finally have an onsen on this side of Sukhumvit. It's nice. Two pools, a hot (40c) and cold (14c). They're both pretty big and can seat quite a few, but the place was pretty empty when I went on Sunday afternoon. The hot one has some jets in a few spots as well. It's gender separated and like normal, you have to be nude in the onsen. Some buckets to dump water on your head or on towels would be nice in here.  Sauna is a bit cold at 75c. This seems common at onsens in Bangkok but is well below what I've seen at Thai Saunas or in Japan. I have no idea why so many places keep them so cool. There are also no towels or pads to sit on in the sauna to keep your sweat off the seats, which is also common in Thailand, although they gave me three towels at reception. Maybe one is supposed to be for that.  Changing room is nice. Has a bathroom and some standup showers. Inside the onsen there are only sit down ones. There's a cooler of lemon water if you want a drink.  Reception is also nice and friendly. They were very accommodating taking my cash. They also offered a drink when leaving too, which i never see anywhere eledit: finally went back for a massage. It was good! 	Clean, new and good atmosphere 	Absolutely loved my visit to Yumoto Wellness Onsen and Spa! The atmosphere is tranquil, the hot springs are perfect, and the massage I received was one of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend this place for a relaxing getaway.

Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a massage that will really help to get the knots out of your muscles. The staff was so friendly and kind. 	We had a great massage in a couple. The massage thai by the school. Every part of my body was massaged. Very knowledgeable and intense experience. Highly recommend it. 	Very good massage, highly recommend it. Very expert and professional staff! It‚Äôs a massage place where they know what a real Thai massage is, they don‚Äôt do it too strong or too soft, very detailed and precise work. I took the foot massage and was informed that the legs are equally important, so they massaged both, and I‚Äôm glad they did! When I left my feet and legs felt like they had forgotten all the walking I did while backpacking for a month. The owner is very social and will inform you about Thai culture if you inquire, you will learn about Thai culture while getting massaged if you want :)	This salon is perfect for those who truly want to experience the essence of Thai massage. At Sinee, Pitcure ƒ± shared who is called One, I had one of the most intense yet beautiful massage experiences of my life from his hand. The massage was quite firm, but also incredibly relaxing and healing. It was completely different from anything I‚Äôve tried before. This is a very local salon and, in my opinion, a hidden gem. If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic Thai massage experience, you should definitely visit this place. 	Lek did an amazing job! She has the hands of an angel. I felt like a new person after being under her caring, strong hands for one hour. And I think I will come back tomorrow. Highly recommend! 	Came here on the way to a tour to kill some time. Nice place hidden in a carpark. We both got the foot massage and it was really good. Mine was quite brutal, but they were very friendly and if it‚Äôs too much to handle, you can just tell them to tone it down a bit. Felt like more a local place, but they welcomed us and looked after us with open arms. One of the best massage experiences in Bangkok! 	Very nice foot massage. Very friendly staff. The entrance is located inside the parking garage for the badminton club, on the right hand side. Look for this sign 	I really needed a Thai massage and I was so happy to find this shop. The entrance is tucked in a parking lot but don‚Äôt let that deceive you. The massage therapist was very skilled. I would love to come back! 	Foot and leg massage was great! They were accommodating with doing only 30 minutes, for half the price. Entrance is at the sports complex, on the right hand side, facing the complex. Friendly staff! 	Wonderful experience! A hidden gem, you have to work to find it a bit but it‚Äôs well worth it. I got a foot massage and my mom got a full body massage and the two workers there did a great job! Thank you!	Really great massage! There wasn't any oil and you had to wear clothes given to you. I'm unsure if that's a custom here, but it was absolutely lovely! 	Amazing massage! Very comfortable, found every knot in my back and leg cannot recommend enough 	Great experience, left relaxed and happy. Shop is spacious and clean, staff is friendly. Intense and strong :) 	Best Thai message ever you can get in BKK If you want real professional thai message you have to try this one Professional, passionate, very polite	This was the best massage I ever had.

The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing, with a soothing scent and soft music that set the perfect mood. The staff was warm and welcoming, making me feel comfortable from the moment I arrived.  I chose the aroma oil massage (lemongrass & eucalyptus), and it was absolutely wonderful. The therapist was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure while using aromatic oils that helped me fully unwind. The combination of gentle strokes and deep relaxation techniques melted away all my stress and tension. After the session, I felt completely refreshed and rejuvenated.  Overall, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-quality Thai massage experience. I will definitely be coming back!	If I can give more than 5 stars I would! The customer service is exceptional! I was looking for a head spa massage to gift for my boyfriend. I reached out to them through Instagram and happy to get a fast and very accomodating response.  They catered to my request of ordering a cake as a birthday gift after the massage and they happily helped me out! They go way beyond and so so happy! As for the ambiance it is very calming and quiet, my bf immediately felt relaxed coming inside. The staff are very nice too! Thank you Erawan Thai massage! üòç 	The atmosphere was good and the spa is clean. Very friendly service and my therapist had very strong hands, however I felt there was a lack of technique and the distribution of time was not even. 85% of it was spent winding 2 knots in my shoulder with her elbows, which really is a shame as the 5 minutes spent on my legs was incredible.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good value for money, as we have had much better massages for a third of the price. 	Perfect relaxation and excellent service!  I had an amazing experience at this massage shop! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing, the staff is extremely friendly and professional. The massage itself was simply perfect ‚Äì the ideal balance between relaxation and deep muscle relief. After the treatment, I felt completely rejuvenated! I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back. Absolutely five stars! 	I had an amazing experience! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was calming and inviting. The staff was incredibly welcoming and made sure I felt comfortable right away.  The massage itself was perfect‚Äîjust the right amount of pressure, and I could feel the tension melting away. The therapist was professional, skilled, and really paid attention to my needs. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed.  Highly recommend! Don't be insecure because it's not central located. the stay is worth it. All the best.	Fantastic experience at this place. I opted for Head Back Shoulder Neck massage and it was handled expertly. They even helped me withdraw cash from nearest ATM because card wasn't working. 	A truly wonderful experience! The therapists are highly skilled, and the atmosphere is clean and relaxing. A perfect retreat for both body and mind. I highly recommend it to everyone! 	Amazing aroma oil massage!

The therapist lady massages extremely well, it was an excellent experience. Whenever I return to Bankok, I will definitely visit her. 	Highly skilled. Had a lovely relaxing aromatherapy and foot massage for 90mins. Lovely atmosphere soft music and lovely smell from the oils. And reasonably priced. A must go to place.

My masseuse was both firm and gentle, striking the perfect balance. My foot massage even came with a complimentary back and shoulder massage, which was a lovely surprise. Wrapped it all up with a soothing cup of tea‚Äîsuch a great experience! 	Love this place and we always come back here when we are in BKK. Currently there is a welcome coconut drink if you visit between 11am-5pm. The massage here is comfortable and the environment is feels great. 	Was a very pleasant experience! Obviously not the cheapest place you can go, but being a block away from where I‚Äôm staying at the Moxy and how great the staff is, I would come back again.  Included with the price with came a welcome coconut to drink out of (coconut only from 11am-5pm), and a tea and biscuit afterwards. 	Had the most incredible Thai oil massage by V. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of massages over the years but this was by far the most detail oriented, intuitive one ‚Äî V got so many cracks out of my back and neck! I feel like i have a brand new spine! 	Amazing experience I got today. I am glad I gave up my thought to go for any other massage parlour and came here for the Office Syndrome Massage. It was a breathtaking experience. The masseuse was too good. I could never imagine they can be so professional! God bless her! May this place keep growing and providing it's services as today. Cannot express more in words. They're too good. 	The store delivered value at the cost of privacy & space. No online reservation. Payment was required upon the f2f booking. My massage therapist was not bad, but was simply pressing me at times (1hr full body). Give it a try, maybe it‚Äôd work for you. 	One of the best Thai Massage in BKK!  So relaxing and the service was amazing I Highly recommended	Pok was amazing. The foot massage was so relaxing that I slept during the procedure. Good pressure and knowledge of all pressure points was the key‚Ä¶highly recommend. 	That'a my first time doing massage at Bangkok, and i'm fall in love at the first Try üòç the therapist is very good, i'm handle by therepist name Sood-Jai n my mom be mrs Yoya, mr. Sood - jai is an expert the massage is hard because my muscle very stiff but i dont feel pain at all , its really a nice experience to massage at City Of Massage because the massage really good, u must try it because after u massage here all ur fatigue from shoping will be disaapear like magic üòÅ	Fantastic experience. Good price, clean and bright environment, staffs are courteous and polite. Massage skills also very good. Def will come back again! 	I had a fantastic one-hour foot massage with V, and I couldn't be more satisfied! From the moment the session began, V displayed great professionalism and skill, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension while ensuring a deeply relaxing experience.  The massage was both therapeutic and rejuvenating‚ÄîV clearly understands how to target pressure points effectively. I left feeling completely refreshed, with lighter, more relaxed feet. The ambiance was also calming, adding to the overall enjoyment of the session.  If you're looking for a skilled and attentive therapist, I highly recommend booking a session with V. I'll definitely be back for another session soon! 	Came across this place by chance and the overall experience for me was a pleasant one. I was a bit doubtful at first as the ‚Äúroom‚Äù they brought me to for 60 mins Thai massage was covered by curtains only, but I truly enjoyed the massage (I heard the receptionist pronouncing the masseur‚Äôs name as Nhong & wrote her name in Thai for me). I love how she spent time to massage areas like shoulders & back - where I usually have stiff muscle due to bad posture and her strength is on-point.  Will definitely return the next time I visit Bangkok. 	Pok pok's service is very good, his approach is friendly and kind. Try it once you will get satisfied. 	My son and I went for foot massage and it was really good. Specially the one who massage me. I asked for strong massage and he really did good. Will come back again soon . My massage guy name V thank you V 	I have been here a few times for the past two visits to Bangkok. They are professional and friendly.  Today, I had V (masseuse name), and he did a pretty good job massaging my feet. He is crafty with his skills and would check on me if I am enjoying the session or not. 	Low key think this place is a scam. Place is not relaxing one bit, massuese feels overworked, mine had barely energy left in her, I had to ask her to take it up several notches. I said I wanted to change my massuese and she did not allow me to. Pricey for what it‚Äôs worth. I would look elsewhere, bigger chains such as Lek.  Avoid the seat at the end. Worst seat ever. Not a comfortable experience and not the standard experience. Please do not get fooled.  Would not be back or will recommend to friends. 	Has to be one of the best places to get a foot massage in Bangkok! I went to a few other places but City of Massage was just something else. From the atmosphere to the masseuse. V gave me an hour long foot massage that left me rejuvenated for the rest of my trip. If you‚Äôre visiting Bangkok and looking for a foot massage, look no further! 	We found this place through google review and the place looks clean from the picture. Usually we would prefer 5 star hotel massage and spa. However this time, I needed to sort out some muscle problem. We decided to check out this massage place.  Located Nearby mall complex such as Platinum bangkok on a 2 way busy street. The place was clean, decent modern design, so we feel quite comfortable.  The staff were friendly and they collect money before the massage session starts.  We decided to take their 2 hour Thai Soul massage. The therapist were so experienced, friendly and sort out all of our tensions and muscle problem.  I would recommend this place especially for travellers or just after a heavy day at work.  This small place was full with customers, so need to walk in earlier to make reservations.  The stars they earned on 888 review on google is real. Must try! 	Walked right in and got seated. Complimentary coconut drink and shoulder and back massage at the end of our foot massage. Best way to recoup after a long day of walking. Highly recommend. Services are great and ambiance is calming 	Was a wonderful experience. My masseuse V was great and very good at what he does. I will definitely recommend it to others.

They're having an opening promo of 600 baht for 1 hour massage in Dec 2024. The massage is super nice and soothing, and the masseuses are experienced. Able to really deep tissue our tension and loosened the knots.  As the place is quieter, they also accepted us even though we walked in. Not shady as well, though the beds are not as comfortable as it's a floor bed rather than a massage bed. Nevertheless, for its price point and effectiveness, it's super worth it and service was excellent too. 	The best Thai massage I've experienced üëç i feel very relaxed and refreshed after the pressure massaged over my body. The staff are polite and kind, the manager also speaks even English and Korean very surprised me ! Highly recommend here Relief Relax and i'll come again for my next visiting BKK. ‚Ä¶ 	Wonderfull staff and therapists. Great atmosphere overall. Facilities and Spa looks nice and well furnished. They provide help and offer great service. Variety of options you can choose from at a decent price too. Definitely one of my favorite spa place in Bangkok would definitely recommend.	Recommended place to give a chance to speak for itself. Polite lady boss and friendly staffs. Clean environment n towels. Room temperature is just right. Definitely hope to see this place expand to a bigger space. 	If you are looking for a Thai massage I am highly recommend this place Relief Relax. The staffs and receptionist are friendly and polite also can speak in Korean, English and a little bit in Chinese üòÅ. My body felt relieved and relaxed. ‚Ä¶ 	Very good experience. Recommended Office Syndrome Massage for 90mins. The therapist provided a very excellent massage for me the staff also good service and polite. Highly recommend here!!! Relief Relax  üëçüèºüëçüèº I‚Äôll come again for sure ^^ ‚Ä¶ 	Working in the same gesture for many hours makes my whole body tense and stressed. I love massage, so I sometimes go massage. I tried this place for the first time. After one hour massage, it released my stress so well. I thought it's gonna be hurt like i went to other place before because of my severe tension. but surprisingly, it's super great. it might be hurt a little bit, but it's in the level that i can bear. i didn't shout like crazy like other place i went before. after this time i decided to go again monthly. moreover, the service was so wonderful. they washed my feet first. they were releasing my tension starting from my legs and so on. after massage, they served tea with sweet riped mango. in the end of the service, i talked to myself that this is worth to spend my salary lol. 	This place was just opened for around 8 months. The staff is friendly and massage here is superb. I went for 60min foot massage and they allowed me to customise with 10min shoulder. They also washed my feet with aroma oil and mineral salt. I was given a private room for 600 baht. I wanted to extend to 90min after experiencing the good massage skill but it was already fully booked üòÖ go for it! Nice mango and fig tea to end off the session. 	Conveniently located but very little other redeeming qualities. I am a big girlie, not old and have been to tons and tons of massages over the years (Thai/Ayurveda/ Swedish/ Hammam , you name it) and this was by far my least favourite one.  I booked a 90 min herbal compress which the price was 2500 baht (understandably high as they need to pay rent).  However the massage was aggressively strong and despite asking for a softer touch it was like being roughed up on a rugby field. The compress itself was lukewarm and added very little to the effect. And to top it off when I told the masseuse it wasn‚Äôt feeling good, she laughed , which I think hurt me more.  I think you can do better by walking a few feet outside the building. Go do that. 	Had a 1.5hr foot massage here and it was so relaxing :) the massage includes a foot bath, private room where you can lie down while they do the massage, and a ~20min head and shoulders massage. At the end, they provide you with mango and tea. The service was excellent and massage was very relaxing. Their masseuse are very professional and experienced as well. Would come back again 	Highly recommend! The place very clean and calm. Staff very expert in massage. Foot massage recommend!! 	My second time visit already. Excellent leg massage. The therapist helped me stretched my legs and the muscle pain after sports and gym was gone on the next day. I also tried body massage last time, very good too. 	Very relaxing 60 min hot aromatherapy massage after a friend recommended this place. Service is great (also provided complimentary tea and mango), convenient location near BTS station and near a lot of the main shopping spots.  Highly recommend and will definitely come back 	The massage was incredibly relaxing and relieved all my tension‚Äîhighly recommend! 	Good cost performance ! My friend recommended me this place it was amazing ! Masseuse very excellent highly recommend I'll come again for sure. 	The office massage was really good, targeting pain points of us who are often at the desk. Although it can be a bit painful (deep tissue pressure massage) during the session, I walked out of the room feeling lighter and better than when I entered. May not be as cheap as other shops along the street, but definitely worthwhile. Will come back again when I visit BKK. 	This massage parlor is very nice. Great service and staffs. Massage quality is worth pay. The shopkeeper also very nice. I come to them almost every month. Love the body scrub.ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	The massage was amazing. The masseuse hit all the right spots. It might be painful to some but that's what you will go through if you want to release the tension.  It's on the higher side in terms of price but that's what you pay for. It comes with quality. (: 	Entering the store for the first time, the atmosphere inside the store is great.  The inside looks clean and has all the equipment.  Excellent reception staff  The masseuse did a good job and felt relaxed.  Overall, everything is good and perfect	Highly recommended. Although it's slightly pricier than other places (paid 1290b for 1.5hr - 30 mins foot and 60 mins back), I felt like it was worth it!  Link (therapist) was excellent. My body felt better immediately!

My partner and I went in for a foot massage, but the masseuse, Hai Hong, recommended that we do half-hour body massage and half-hour feet massage, noting that the tiredness in our legs may be an effect of the tiredness in our backs. We heeded her recommendation and we were very much satisfied. It was one of the best massages we've had! Our masseuses, Hai Hong and Xin Er, were very attentive to the knots and bolts we had in our bodies and did a very good job of getting them off. We're very grateful and we'll be recommending them to our friends visiting Brussels. üòä 	I have been coming here since 2017 and I bring other people to this place as it is fantastic. Note that I'm a massage therapist. They are the only ones that are allowed to do deep tissue on me. Wonderful!!! 	Wonderful foot,  back and shoulder massage! Very relaxing and left feeling great! Would go back for sure! 	I‚Äôm not a big fan of massages to be honest but this one was like the best back painkiller! I felt relaxed afterwards and just so calm  I will definitely come back üòá 	The best massage in my whole life! Unbelievable!! It's worth 100%!!! 	The Best massage ever. I highly recommend. If you want real massage this is the place. Very professional. 	I arrived late on a Sunday and Hi Hung squeezed me in. I had a stiff neck and back from workouts and travel. Hi Hung gave me a terrific massage. She applied the perfect amount of pressure and included cupping in the treatment. I will visit again when next in this lovely city. 	Got a foot massage with my wife here after a long day of travelling for our honeymoon! It was so outstanding that we are moving around our plans to come back later in the week for a full body massage.  We had two separate masseuse/masseurs and both were incredibly courteous and professional, and they stayed past closing to give us the full duration of our massage. They spoke French, English, and Chinese well, and even gave us local recommendations for nearby things to do! 	est massage in Bruxelles!  Everytime i‚Äôm suffering migraine, headaches, body pains and etc, this massage place is my go-to.  They do multiple massage techniques to ease all your pain.  After every session I feel sooo much better and they make sure that all pain are gone.  I‚Äôll recommend to everyone.	Staff was very accommodating and responsive. Came at a less busy time and got an appointment quickly. She did everything! Guasha, cupping and some heat thing (no pain). She identified the pain points and helped relieve them 	TOTALLY RECOMMEND! So worth the (very tolerable) pain. I felt so relaxed and in peace afterwards! better sleep and better breathing as well. I am definitely coming back for another massage +++ Soumaya 	First experience here, came because of the reviews and had a duo massage. Very receptive, hospitable, very knowledgeable masseuses. Was able to make a last minute appointment the day of. Leaning towards more targeted massage to ease the knots in your body than relaxing and overall satisfied with the service.	Honestly a very good massage place, I was surprised as I thought it might be overpriced as it‚Äôs so central and touristy, but the service was efficient and polite and the massage was really good, using scraping and cupping to enhance. Will be going back here. 	Such an amazing experience! The salon was nice and clean. Super friendly masseuse and customer-oriented. She definitely knew what my body needed. Came out with a whole new body. Highly recommended!!! 	I love this place - my 6th time here. When I come from Switzerland on a business trip I stop here and I go on demand and I have the best massage of my lifeüíÜ ‚Ä¶ 	I originally came to Brussels to travel, but because of the writing of thesis shoulder pain unbearable, just roadside casually find a Chinese medicine massage, I did not expect the effect is simply immediate! The owner's wife is super nice and patient! And the price is the best value for money in the neighbourhood! Highly recommended! ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	It was my first visit but by far, the best chinese massage place I've visited in Brussels. Hai Hong is a real therapist,she knows what she is doing and fix what need to fixed. It was a relief for my neck and shoulder. Thank you Hai Hong, 5 stars is not enough for you ! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ	Best massage I have ever had! Hai Hong is the name of the lady who I discovered the first time I went to this salon and since then I never wanted to change the masseuse. She is higly competent, fun and charming. But most importantly - she performs magic with her hands. The first time she massaged me, she made a knot in my neck that I had for years, disappear. In one single session (using the manual technique and the cupping) I higly recommend this salon which I will miss greatly now that I have to leave Brussels.	This was my first time visiting the Massage Chinois. I found the place through Google and it turned out to be an amazing experience! I made an appointment originally for deep tissue massage to relieve the chronic shoulder/neck pain that I have. Hai Hong who was my masseur realized the knot soon she started and decisively recommended that I do cupping and acupuncture treatment because she believed massage alone won't be able to clear the knot. She was correct because I could no longer feel the knot after the treatment. The knot had always been there over the years and many masseurs gave up to work on it (pain was temporarily relieved). So, I am very happy with the outcome. Hai Hong is also very experienced because she accurately pinpointed the problems on my other body parts based on my response to ear and feet massage. So, I strongly recommend her to everyone because she is professional, friendly and genuinely passionate to help people. I will return for sure! 	mom and I are from Thailand. We came to the grand place square, we had the opportunity to massage chinois 168 and we were very impressed. The staff is friendly , she speaks multiple languages. and she massaged very well . After coming for a massage, I felt that the aches and pains were clearly gone. If you have a chance to walk around gland place square, I would recommend you to come to massage chinois 168.

Foot massage will be 200 bhat for one hour. It‚Äôs worth it to try if you come for shopping all day long. It helps you relieve the pain of your feet. 	Had an amazing experience here with my family. Total of 3 pax. The place is very clean and cozy. The staffs and the lady Boss are friendly. We had a 90mins body massage and it was very comfortable and professional.  We had an amazing time here. Highly recommended. 	I was quite exhausted and stressed today. My back felt heavy and painful. Thankfully, I decided to try a massage at this spa. And I was quite delighted with the service they provided. It is worth the money. Honestly, after the massage, I went from really stressed and fatigue to feeling completely  relaxed. I will definitely come back.	Initially, i had some doubts about the place because it was a little sketchy at the 2nd floor. Personally had the 1 hour thai massage and lo and behold, it was the best thai message ive ever had! For context i am from the Philippines and i always get thai massages from the Philippines. Anyway, the thai massage was too good. We went down the 1st floor and saw the line of people getting foot massages. Due to the immense joy we had, we also decided to get the 1 hr foot massage as well. It did not disappoint! Objectively speaking the massage is a 9/10, the attitude of my masseuse was 9/10, ambiance is a 7/10, and price is 8.5/10. Would definitely go here again when I go back to bangkok! 	Very nice experience, I had a foot and shoulder massage. Mod was very very good and professional.  I have received many Thai massages in my life as I have spend nearly a year here and it was one of the best! Recommend 100%!	5/5 stars! I highly recommend Pratunum Thai Massage for a consistently exceptional massage experience. My go-to masseuse is Rot - she's incredibly skilled, strong, and always targets my trouble spots. I've never been disappointed! If you're looking for a reliable and rejuvenating massage, look no further." 	I had a fantastic massage here and it was so affordable!  The staff were all super friendly and helpful too.  It was really relaxing and I felt so much better afterwards.  Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a great massage.  I'll definitely be back! 	Very disappointing experience. This was by far the worst massage I‚Äôve ever had. The therapist clearly lacked both technique and experience. I booked a one-hour foot massage, but she repeated the same motion the entire time with no variation. Despite asking multiple times for more pressure, she barely adjusted and continued with a very lazy approach. It felt like she wasn‚Äôt even trying. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. 	Excellent service, good masseuse no hard selling. No need tippimg. The reviews speak for each self. A++++ 	We had amazing Thai massages after a long day of walking around Bangkok! They also gave me an outfit to change into to make sure I was comfortable (and covered) throughout the massage as well. Highly recommend! 	Authentic Thai massage with a very reasonable price. Masseuse was well trained and well spoken. She knows English. Very calm. She was excellent at the work. They will take once the massage finishes. Very dedicated staff. Loved the service very much 10/10 	It‚Äôs cheap but they don‚Äôt take the time they sell (had at least 10 min less) and they make it very quick. The girl that massaged me pinched my thighs at least 5 times cause she sat on them and was very, very hard and therefore hardly relaxing. Also she tried to convince me to take 1,5 hours instead of one hour while already massaging me (highly unprofessional cause I already decided). It's cheap but still not recommended. 	Best massage ever in the town!! Will come back tonight 	Taking oil relaxaxing massage, very worth the price for 400 thb for 1 hour. They have clean and private room. The massage is very good and strong, very relaxing 	I have been to different massage places for some foot massage, and this place is definitely the one I will come back to when in town. Very good massage. My feet feels so light afterwards. The place might not look as good in comparison to newer places, but the price and massage is definitely better (solely based on my experience). 	I just got a 1 hour full body Thai massage and it was such a good experience! I was just walking around and I stumbled upon this place, checked the prices and the reviews and I was convinced. The lady was hitting all the right spots and I told her where it was more painful and she ‚Äúcustomized‚Äù the massage. Would totally recommend üòÅ ‚Ä¶ 	Foot massage was not impressive, basically just rubbing oil on the shins, not much attention paid to the feet. Massage salon is quite dirty, furniture is worn out. I do not recommend wasting your time and money here üëé ‚Ä¶ 	This place will be my go-to Thai massage. I got my foot massage here. They have good massage techniques and the atmosphere is nice. Compared to other stores that I went to, I'm very satisfied with this place.	Came here for the great reviews. And it was the closest massage shop at that point to me with a back pain and feet. We tried the coconut body massage however didn‚Äôt really suit us i guess.  It was too strong for me and my body still hurt after the session üòÖ ‚Ä¶ 	We got the 1-hour foot and back massage. It was great. The pressure and technique was very good. They wash your feet first then give you tea at the end. For the combination massage, you are sitting for the back portion - not laying flat. We will definitely return when we‚Äôre in the area.

But surely the massage is comparable around. What is nice here is ambience and gives you a relaxing environment and private space. Best isnthe staff- friendly, courteous and honest that i left my watch in the massage room and they kept it for me even i came back a week after to claim it they still kept it safely. Thank you 	massage is great, espsecially the shop is close at 3am. very good for relax at midnigt. 	Thank you Grand massage and Spa I got your The grandset package  I like your quality service I highly recommend to everyone there is 1 guy in staff Suleman they're very kind and humble We enjoyed the service alot.üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Very helpful staff and welcoming, most importantly the whole massage session was really relaxing and calming after a long day of shopping üëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	I had a bad experience during my recent visit. Though the atmosphere was pleasant, I found the massage itself to be less professional than I had hoped. Additionally, I was surprised that the worker did not leave the room while I was changing clothes, which felt uncomfortable.  Moreover, the tidying up was done so quickly that I was still in the room, and I wasn't assisted in cleaning off the oil after the session. I believe there is room for improvement in these areas to enhance the overall client experience. I will never revisit. 	I was really looking forward to my visit after reading all the great reviews, but unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I was paired with a therapist who seemed inexperienced, and it really affected the quality of the session. I had informed the reception about an injury beforehand, but I still had to remind the therapist three times to avoid that area before finally asking her to stop massaging this spot altogether (it was one of the time you wished you had taken a shorter massage!). At this price point, you would expect a much better attention to detail and overall experience. Hopefully, this feedback will help improve the experience for future clients. 	Great service and very attentive. The place is clean and tidy. Did a 2 hour foot massage after shopping and it was so relaxing.  A welcome drink and hot tea were provided before and after the massage. Will defn come again! 	Amazinggggggggg! Beautiful building. Everything is very clean and calming. Best massage I‚Äôve had, highly recommend the hot oil scalp massage (it‚Äôll mess up your hair but feels great and hydrates your hair). Will absolutely come back 	Grand massage & spa is a good place to get a Luxury service and the staff also humble best place to get some luxury quality massage üòâ ‚Ä¶ 	I've been to Thailand a few times now. This spa has good massage therapists. If you're in the area, you have options to choose from. I had the 60 minutes hot stone massage, and it was worth every baht. 	Oil massage, the masseur was inexperienced, unable converse in english.. not worth the money and time here..Suggest the owner to provide proper training and hiring experience staff. Disappointing. 	Beautiful experience, professional staff. Very competent. Perfect privacy in the private rooms. Quiet place. I will recommend to everyone.	It was quiet, the facilities were good, and the staff was friendly. I went to many massage parlors, but it was the most refreshing massage of all. I plan to go again tomorrow.	Thank you for your great service we really enjoyed alot great massage and kind staff üòäüôèüèª ‚Ä¶ 	Best massage in BKK and Suleman  was very good with his knowledge and recommendations done by him, I was satisfied and feel very relaxed and calm. If anyone looking for massage go for grand massage 	One of the best massage ever I had in Bangkok and I‚Äôm really thankful to Mr salmon to giving a humble full service and hospitality‚Ä¶ 	I got a great time here, took a good rest and have a foot massage. The environment here is so relaxing and soothing. 	Was a wonderful experience! The masseuse was amazing and was able to hit the right spots! 	they have excellent technique and their service is top-notch. totally worth it 	Thank you so much for your great service we like it a lot ü§ó ‚Ä¶

I have come here 2 days in a row. First time, I only had a 1hr foot massage, second time I had both a 1-hr foot massage and a 1-hr Thai Balm massage. My massage therapist (Mook) has a touch which is a relaxing firmness, enough to send me off to sleep or at least nap.  It isn't crowded with lots of staff trying sell their services.  Bonus: They have a pair of beautiful pampered cats who keep check on everyone. 	These ladies know what they‚Äôre doing and they are super friendly and very nice.  Best leg massage for sure , and it‚Äôs just 250 baht only ,  And we did Thai massage as well it‚Äôs really good too , they are professionals for sure üíØ  And this pretty lady in this picture she‚Äôs really nice,  Will visit there again when we back Thailand soon ‚ù§Ô∏è	Chanced upon another massage shop while making my way back to the hotel. Since my foot was still sore from the walking, I decided to go for a foot massage before heading back to my hotel. There were quite a few customers when I was there.  I opted for the Thai foot massage, which was 250baht for 60 minutes. The masseur that was assigned to me was an elderly lady. Have to say, the massage was enjoyable till I fell asleep. She applies alot strength but it feels comfortable. After the massage, I felt so relaxed, and the fatigue was gone.  Overall, discovered another gem in the area. Wouldn't mind coming back again in the future. 	Me and my family used this massage about five times in seven days. My kids were looking forward to it almost on everyday basis.  The foot massage was very good. We got the massage before going to bed at midnight. If you are staying at KC Place Hotel or anywhere nearby, you must check out this massage place. Highly recommended. 	Excellent massage. We went for 2 hours oil and Thai balm body massage. It was so comfortable that I fell asleep, a good balance between a relaxing and technically satisfying massage. It opens at 12pm, not 11am on Google 	For 250 baht one of the cheapest but good quality Thai massage especially if you‚Äôre into sports - I asked for extra pressure and the ladies know exactly what they‚Äôre doing.  Always free as it‚Äôs tucked away from the main streets and they have three lovely gentle cats to greet you at the door	We chose this massage place based on its 5-star reviews, but unfortunately, our visit turned into a disaster. Despite confirming a couple's room over the phone, we were surprised to find out that we weren‚Äôt the only people inside the room doing the massage. I spent the first 2 minutes begging my wife's masseuse for being excessively talkative and noisy. The disappointment doesn‚Äôt end there, halfway through the massage, my wife screamed in pain because her masseuse twisted her left arm as if she was trying to pull it out. We wanted to leave but the manager intervened and replaced my wife's masseuse, we reluctantly stayed to finish the session.	The massage skills are weak, relatively unhieginic. Sadly I started thinking that my body will feel even worse after the massage. 	Had a good 1 hr foot massage. Environment is very clean. Masseuse were able to speak English. 250baht. There were 3 cute cats too	Old and gold technique of traditional FEET and SOLE massage, definitely give this a MUST if you want your SOLE and Soul to feel great after a long day of walking 	I had a very good foot massage here, and with 250B for the 1h option, it is one of the cheapest I‚Äôve seen in Thailand. My masseuse had very strong fingers and could give me a pressure massage like I enjoy them :) Also really liked the little arms and shoulder massage we got at the end. The massage studio has 3 cats who roam around, but they must be trained to not come to clients as they stayed around the non-working personal.	They are so professional and know what they are doing, especially everyone is so friendly. Glad doing this after a tiring walking day. Feels so relaxing. 	Bad experience. I came for a thai massage after walking all day. They don't provide an eztra set of clothes to change into. They don't turn on the aircon for thai massage room. It was very warm. I changed to foot massage and masseuse seemed annoyed. Kept checking the time whole time. masseuse v annoyed whole time. ended earlier even with the disruption. not good.	Hidden gem with a good foot massage for as little as 250 Baht (04/24).  There was often staff coming in and going out and some friends or family, talking with the personnel. This took a little bit of the relaxation away, but made me not feel guilty of using my phone as well for researching new sights to discover.	i have been here twice for a Thai body massage and turns out it was so good. i felt so relaxed and the sore on my body was gone. The masseur was so nice and really understand with the pain location in my body. i'm so glad that this place was really nearby with my hotel and to mention the price was really affordable. Big Thumbs Up! 	The massage was okay. Because the masseur was a little lazy when massaging head. It seemed like she was checking her mobile. However, the cats are so cute which you don't wanna miss. 	Was fortunate to stumble across this place on the way back home after a long day. My partner and I had a foot massage each, performed by Mook and Mina(?). The stress and struggles of the day and life melted away. We're by no means Thai massage aficionados but these ladies were attentive and gave us their undivided time and attention. Many thanks 	Omg‚Ä¶ the best 250B foot massage! And they are super nice too! 	Good ambient music and a comfortable chair to enjoy your massage in. The masseuse were pretty good and overall the foot massage was relaxing after a long day‚Äôs of walking. Only downside is that they ended about 15 minutes earlier than expected. They even have a cute Siamese cat roaming the store! 	The therapist is very professional. Super enjoyable

If you are in need of high-quality services at incredible pricing and great customer service, look no further and come here! They are located on the second level of MBK shopping center, level 2, zone D. I was able to schedule a walk-in appointment immediately after I submitted a WhatsApp message. They were very responsive to me. The facilities are luxuriously, opulent, clean and modern! They service you with tea, cookies and water warm towels before and after the service! My massage therapist  was fantastic!  I Will be back again for service when I revisit Bangkok! 	Super amazing massage place. It's a hidden gem in mbk. I always Come here for foot massage. U get complimentary head hand n shoulder massage also. Once u enter the place it feels super luxurious and their staff are also very hospitable. Their massage staff are super humble and amazing and great massage concentrating on all pressure points 	Very causy and chique equipment with a modern, comfy couple massage room and shower. Service was outstanding, one of the best massage I've had so far in Bangkok. Staff (receptionist & masseurs) were very polite and caring. Recommended spot!!	With time to kill before a nearly 9 hour flight home, the wife and I decided to kill some time with a 1 hour foot massage. What a tremendous idea as this massage instantly gave me back some much needed energy for my last day in Bangkok! My 1 hour foot massage was more like a full body relaxation massage. It was so good I nearly fell asleep! When at MBK, do yourself a favour and drop in for some rest and recharging! 	This was such a lovely experience! We received a massage here as a gift and we left feeling lighter than air 	VERY GOOD, 1 person is 700bath, only for foot massage only. But they welcomed me with a glass of sweet cold tea and a very cool towel.  The workers are professionally skilled and provide attentive service.  After walking around MBK center with sore and tired feet, I came here.  I even came twice in 2 days 	I‚Äôm visiting Bangkok for the first time from Dallas Texas and did a stop at Grand Massage and Spa! Let me start off first saying this place is absolutely amazing! From the time we walked in the door! Me and 2 other friends visited for the first time! We all enjoyed our experience to the fullest! Everyone was so nice friendly and welcoming! The place is clean and smells so good! My massage was the best message I‚Äôve had in my entire life!! I want to stay in Bangkok just for this spa!! Thank you for such an amazing experience and making my friends birthday one of her best yet! 	This place makes me to come back whenever I come to Bangkok. This is my second time. The place is peaceful and clean. Their service is on the top. Take your time and must visit. I highly recommended to you all if you spare time. 	Jinny my therapist was fabulous. I booked in to get their foot massage . From the minute you walk in, the  attention to detail is unparalleled . They are very clean and well trained and extremely polite and courteous. She was technically very well trained and was able to destress my extremely tired feet legs and then my neck and shoulders which came in as an added bonus . I couldn‚Äôt praise them enough and wish I had another day to get another one of their ritualsüòî but will definitely do so on my next visit. Thank you Jinny and thank you Grand Massage and Spa, keep up the good work. 	Let‚Äôs just say, this place totally lives up to the name.  Beautiful decor for ambiance and had one of the most amazing massages of my life!!!  This will be a definite stop, every trip to Bangkok. 	If you come to Bangkok and by chance visit the MBK centre please please please come here. The staff have made me feel so comfortable since arrival, and the lady who gave me my treatment was just unbelievable. With complimentary tea before and after the small touches are beautiful. I will definitely visit again. Such a beautiful relaxing and tranquil experience. ü´∂üèº‚ù§Ô∏è	Highly recommend this place. Very clean and excellent service. It may be a little bit more expensive than other spas because it is inside a shopping mall with high foot traffic but well worth it especially after a whole day of walking. Everyone was extremely polite and the ambiance was very calming. 	I have been to so many spas and this is by far one of the best spas in Bangkok. The atmosphere of this place is absolutely so tranquil and the staff is incredibly skilled and attentive. I highly recommend getting the aromatic hot stone massage, the best treatment I‚Äôve ever had. 	Fantastic is a very small word for them. Amazing and a very courteous staff. Fabulous service. I come here every time I visit Thailand . 	Been going to Grand Massage and Spa in MBK more frequently ever since trying trying their aroma oil massage. This spa is truly a relaxing place to de-stress and experience luxury VIP spa services. Highly recommend to give it a try! üòÅ ‚Ä¶ 	What a mazing spa in Bangkok. I did Thai and Oil massage for 90 mins. The price is resonable - give me the best experience.	I had a foot, shoulder and back massage twice here.  The interior is clean, prestine with nice scent all around. There was a welcome drink, together with bottled water and towel to freshen up for patrons when they arrive.  They used salt to scrub the feet slightly first, which is very rare for most massage palours.  They have large comfy massage sofas and open beds, with curtains to provide some privacy for patrons. The therapists were also very quiet and there was no unnecessary chatting among themselves to maintain the zen and peace for patrons.  After the massage, they also serve hot tea with biscuit. The service staff were courteous, speak English well and there was no issue with any communication.  My therapist was Dadar. Highly recommend if you are in MBK shopping. 	The interiors of this place, the professionalism and the kindness of the staff is superlative. I only wished to have more time to spend here to enjoy the best treatment. The only out of tune is a bit about the continuous in and out movement of customers that disturbs a but probably it's because I choose the peak time. Strongly recommend anyway...	This was my second time went to Grand Massage and Spa and the services i had was excellent. My masseur know her stuff well and i strongly recommend to try their foot massage and aroma oil massage  The ambience was also very clean as well too and will not hesitate to visit Grand Massage and Spa again 	Was in BKK with wife and friends and we try out a few massage parlours and coming out disappointed.  It was not till my wife came upon Grand Massage at MBK by chance, then it excited us.  They provide nice welcome drink and a cold towel to refresh us before the assigned massage therapist attends to you. And after the massage, they serve you with nice hot tea (not those ginger tea).  Unlike those I visited while in BKK or Malaysia, certain details are so different and it gives a new experience like hot towel for the massage your neck and shoulder.  Phon, the massage therapist was very attentive to my pain point and will go lightly before he exert strength again.  This is my second visit in 2 days as the group like the service and the type of massage we hoping for.
