Based on the 20 provided reviews, generate:
- 8 positive reviews
- 2 lightly negative reviews

Constraints:
- Include personal experiences and feelings.
- Use natural, human-like expressions.
- Each review should be between 8 and 20 words.
- Negative reviews should be soft and not too harsh.
- Do not add extra new lines. the output will contain only 10 lines.
- Do not add extra commentary or explanations. just output a list of 10 reviews, each on a separate line without any bullet points or so.
- If the content includes elements such as quality of service, impression, emotional impact, or value for money, therapist's name, wrap them with <strong><u></u></strong> tags. (only for positive reviews)
- However, avoid overuse — apply it only where it naturally draws the reader’s attention without overwhelming the text.
