I have come here 2 days in a row. First time, I only had a 1hr foot massage, second time I had both a 1-hr foot massage and a 1-hr Thai Balm massage. My massage therapist (Mook) has a touch which is a relaxing firmness, enough to send me off to sleep or at least nap.  It isn't crowded with lots of staff trying sell their services.  Bonus: They have a pair of beautiful pampered cats who keep check on everyone. 	These ladies know what they‚Äôre doing and they are super friendly and very nice.  Best leg massage for sure , and it‚Äôs just 250 baht only ,  And we did Thai massage as well it‚Äôs really good too , they are professionals for sure üíØ  And this pretty lady in this picture she‚Äôs really nice,  Will visit there again when we back Thailand soon ‚ù§Ô∏è	Chanced upon another massage shop while making my way back to the hotel. Since my foot was still sore from the walking, I decided to go for a foot massage before heading back to my hotel. There were quite a few customers when I was there.  I opted for the Thai foot massage, which was 250baht for 60 minutes. The masseur that was assigned to me was an elderly lady. Have to say, the massage was enjoyable till I fell asleep. She applies alot strength but it feels comfortable. After the massage, I felt so relaxed, and the fatigue was gone.  Overall, discovered another gem in the area. Wouldn't mind coming back again in the future. 	Me and my family used this massage about five times in seven days. My kids were looking forward to it almost on everyday basis.  The foot massage was very good. We got the massage before going to bed at midnight. If you are staying at KC Place Hotel or anywhere nearby, you must check out this massage place. Highly recommended. 	Excellent massage. We went for 2 hours oil and Thai balm body massage. It was so comfortable that I fell asleep, a good balance between a relaxing and technically satisfying massage. It opens at 12pm, not 11am on Google 	For 250 baht one of the cheapest but good quality Thai massage especially if you‚Äôre into sports - I asked for extra pressure and the ladies know exactly what they‚Äôre doing.  Always free as it‚Äôs tucked away from the main streets and they have three lovely gentle cats to greet you at the door	We chose this massage place based on its 5-star reviews, but unfortunately, our visit turned into a disaster. Despite confirming a couple's room over the phone, we were surprised to find out that we weren‚Äôt the only people inside the room doing the massage. I spent the first 2 minutes begging my wife's masseuse for being excessively talkative and noisy. The disappointment doesn‚Äôt end there, halfway through the massage, my wife screamed in pain because her masseuse twisted her left arm as if she was trying to pull it out. We wanted to leave but the manager intervened and replaced my wife's masseuse, we reluctantly stayed to finish the session.	The massage skills are weak, relatively unhieginic. Sadly I started thinking that my body will feel even worse after the massage. 	Had a good 1 hr foot massage. Environment is very clean. Masseuse were able to speak English. 250baht. There were 3 cute cats too	Old and gold technique of traditional FEET and SOLE massage, definitely give this a MUST if you want your SOLE and Soul to feel great after a long day of walking 	I had a very good foot massage here, and with 250B for the 1h option, it is one of the cheapest I‚Äôve seen in Thailand. My masseuse had very strong fingers and could give me a pressure massage like I enjoy them :) Also really liked the little arms and shoulder massage we got at the end. The massage studio has 3 cats who roam around, but they must be trained to not come to clients as they stayed around the non-working personal.	They are so professional and know what they are doing, especially everyone is so friendly. Glad doing this after a tiring walking day. Feels so relaxing. 	Bad experience. I came for a thai massage after walking all day. They don't provide an eztra set of clothes to change into. They don't turn on the aircon for thai massage room. It was very warm. I changed to foot massage and masseuse seemed annoyed. Kept checking the time whole time. masseuse v annoyed whole time. ended earlier even with the disruption. not good.	Hidden gem with a good foot massage for as little as 250 Baht (04/24).  There was often staff coming in and going out and some friends or family, talking with the personnel. This took a little bit of the relaxation away, but made me not feel guilty of using my phone as well for researching new sights to discover.	i have been here twice for a Thai body massage and turns out it was so good. i felt so relaxed and the sore on my body was gone. The masseur was so nice and really understand with the pain location in my body. i'm so glad that this place was really nearby with my hotel and to mention the price was really affordable. Big Thumbs Up! 	The massage was okay. Because the masseur was a little lazy when massaging head. It seemed like she was checking her mobile. However, the cats are so cute which you don't wanna miss. 	Was fortunate to stumble across this place on the way back home after a long day. My partner and I had a foot massage each, performed by Mook and Mina(?). The stress and struggles of the day and life melted away. We're by no means Thai massage aficionados but these ladies were attentive and gave us their undivided time and attention. Many thanks 	Omg‚Ä¶ the best 250B foot massage! And they are super nice too! 	Good ambient music and a comfortable chair to enjoy your massage in. The masseuse were pretty good and overall the foot massage was relaxing after a long day‚Äôs of walking. Only downside is that they ended about 15 minutes earlier than expected. They even have a cute Siamese cat roaming the store! 	The therapist is very professional. Super enjoyable
