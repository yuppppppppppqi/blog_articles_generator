If you are in need of high-quality services at incredible pricing and great customer service, look no further and come here! They are located on the second level of MBK shopping center, level 2, zone D. I was able to schedule a walk-in appointment immediately after I submitted a WhatsApp message. They were very responsive to me. The facilities are luxuriously, opulent, clean and modern! They service you with tea, cookies and water warm towels before and after the service! My massage therapist  was fantastic!  I Will be back again for service when I revisit Bangkok! 	Super amazing massage place. It's a hidden gem in mbk. I always Come here for foot massage. U get complimentary head hand n shoulder massage also. Once u enter the place it feels super luxurious and their staff are also very hospitable. Their massage staff are super humble and amazing and great massage concentrating on all pressure points 	Very causy and chique equipment with a modern, comfy couple massage room and shower. Service was outstanding, one of the best massage I've had so far in Bangkok. Staff (receptionist & masseurs) were very polite and caring. Recommended spot!!	With time to kill before a nearly 9 hour flight home, the wife and I decided to kill some time with a 1 hour foot massage. What a tremendous idea as this massage instantly gave me back some much needed energy for my last day in Bangkok! My 1 hour foot massage was more like a full body relaxation massage. It was so good I nearly fell asleep! When at MBK, do yourself a favour and drop in for some rest and recharging! 	This was such a lovely experience! We received a massage here as a gift and we left feeling lighter than air 	VERY GOOD, 1 person is 700bath, only for foot massage only. But they welcomed me with a glass of sweet cold tea and a very cool towel.  The workers are professionally skilled and provide attentive service.  After walking around MBK center with sore and tired feet, I came here.  I even came twice in 2 days 	I‚Äôm visiting Bangkok for the first time from Dallas Texas and did a stop at Grand Massage and Spa! Let me start off first saying this place is absolutely amazing! From the time we walked in the door! Me and 2 other friends visited for the first time! We all enjoyed our experience to the fullest! Everyone was so nice friendly and welcoming! The place is clean and smells so good! My massage was the best message I‚Äôve had in my entire life!! I want to stay in Bangkok just for this spa!! Thank you for such an amazing experience and making my friends birthday one of her best yet! 	This place makes me to come back whenever I come to Bangkok. This is my second time. The place is peaceful and clean. Their service is on the top. Take your time and must visit. I highly recommended to you all if you spare time. 	Jinny my therapist was fabulous. I booked in to get their foot massage . From the minute you walk in, the  attention to detail is unparalleled . They are very clean and well trained and extremely polite and courteous. She was technically very well trained and was able to destress my extremely tired feet legs and then my neck and shoulders which came in as an added bonus . I couldn‚Äôt praise them enough and wish I had another day to get another one of their ritualsüòî but will definitely do so on my next visit. Thank you Jinny and thank you Grand Massage and Spa, keep up the good work. 	Let‚Äôs just say, this place totally lives up to the name.  Beautiful decor for ambiance and had one of the most amazing massages of my life!!!  This will be a definite stop, every trip to Bangkok. 	If you come to Bangkok and by chance visit the MBK centre please please please come here. The staff have made me feel so comfortable since arrival, and the lady who gave me my treatment was just unbelievable. With complimentary tea before and after the small touches are beautiful. I will definitely visit again. Such a beautiful relaxing and tranquil experience. ü´∂üèº‚ù§Ô∏è	Highly recommend this place. Very clean and excellent service. It may be a little bit more expensive than other spas because it is inside a shopping mall with high foot traffic but well worth it especially after a whole day of walking. Everyone was extremely polite and the ambiance was very calming. 	I have been to so many spas and this is by far one of the best spas in Bangkok. The atmosphere of this place is absolutely so tranquil and the staff is incredibly skilled and attentive. I highly recommend getting the aromatic hot stone massage, the best treatment I‚Äôve ever had. 	Fantastic is a very small word for them. Amazing and a very courteous staff. Fabulous service. I come here every time I visit Thailand . 	Been going to Grand Massage and Spa in MBK more frequently ever since trying trying their aroma oil massage. This spa is truly a relaxing place to de-stress and experience luxury VIP spa services. Highly recommend to give it a try! üòÅ ‚Ä¶ 	What a mazing spa in Bangkok. I did Thai and Oil massage for 90 mins. The price is resonable - give me the best experience.	I had a foot, shoulder and back massage twice here.  The interior is clean, prestine with nice scent all around. There was a welcome drink, together with bottled water and towel to freshen up for patrons when they arrive.  They used salt to scrub the feet slightly first, which is very rare for most massage palours.  They have large comfy massage sofas and open beds, with curtains to provide some privacy for patrons. The therapists were also very quiet and there was no unnecessary chatting among themselves to maintain the zen and peace for patrons.  After the massage, they also serve hot tea with biscuit. The service staff were courteous, speak English well and there was no issue with any communication.  My therapist was Dadar. Highly recommend if you are in MBK shopping. 	The interiors of this place, the professionalism and the kindness of the staff is superlative. I only wished to have more time to spend here to enjoy the best treatment. The only out of tune is a bit about the continuous in and out movement of customers that disturbs a but probably it's because I choose the peak time. Strongly recommend anyway...	This was my second time went to Grand Massage and Spa and the services i had was excellent. My masseur know her stuff well and i strongly recommend to try their foot massage and aroma oil massage  The ambience was also very clean as well too and will not hesitate to visit Grand Massage and Spa again 	Was in BKK with wife and friends and we try out a few massage parlours and coming out disappointed.  It was not till my wife came upon Grand Massage at MBK by chance, then it excited us.  They provide nice welcome drink and a cold towel to refresh us before the assigned massage therapist attends to you. And after the massage, they serve you with nice hot tea (not those ginger tea).  Unlike those I visited while in BKK or Malaysia, certain details are so different and it gives a new experience like hot towel for the massage your neck and shoulder.  Phon, the massage therapist was very attentive to my pain point and will go lightly before he exert strength again.  This is my second visit in 2 days as the group like the service and the type of massage we hoping for.
