My partner and I went in for a foot massage, but the masseuse, Hai Hong, recommended that we do half-hour body massage and half-hour feet massage, noting that the tiredness in our legs may be an effect of the tiredness in our backs. We heeded her recommendation and we were very much satisfied. It was one of the best massages we've had! Our masseuses, Hai Hong and Xin Er, were very attentive to the knots and bolts we had in our bodies and did a very good job of getting them off. We're very grateful and we'll be recommending them to our friends visiting Brussels. üòä 	I have been coming here since 2017 and I bring other people to this place as it is fantastic. Note that I'm a massage therapist. They are the only ones that are allowed to do deep tissue on me. Wonderful!!! 	Wonderful foot,  back and shoulder massage! Very relaxing and left feeling great! Would go back for sure! 	I‚Äôm not a big fan of massages to be honest but this one was like the best back painkiller! I felt relaxed afterwards and just so calm  I will definitely come back üòá 	The best massage in my whole life! Unbelievable!! It's worth 100%!!! 	The Best massage ever. I highly recommend. If you want real massage this is the place. Very professional. 	I arrived late on a Sunday and Hi Hung squeezed me in. I had a stiff neck and back from workouts and travel. Hi Hung gave me a terrific massage. She applied the perfect amount of pressure and included cupping in the treatment. I will visit again when next in this lovely city. 	Got a foot massage with my wife here after a long day of travelling for our honeymoon! It was so outstanding that we are moving around our plans to come back later in the week for a full body massage.  We had two separate masseuse/masseurs and both were incredibly courteous and professional, and they stayed past closing to give us the full duration of our massage. They spoke French, English, and Chinese well, and even gave us local recommendations for nearby things to do! 	est massage in Bruxelles!  Everytime i‚Äôm suffering migraine, headaches, body pains and etc, this massage place is my go-to.  They do multiple massage techniques to ease all your pain.  After every session I feel sooo much better and they make sure that all pain are gone.  I‚Äôll recommend to everyone.	Staff was very accommodating and responsive. Came at a less busy time and got an appointment quickly. She did everything! Guasha, cupping and some heat thing (no pain). She identified the pain points and helped relieve them 	TOTALLY RECOMMEND! So worth the (very tolerable) pain. I felt so relaxed and in peace afterwards! better sleep and better breathing as well. I am definitely coming back for another massage +++ Soumaya 	First experience here, came because of the reviews and had a duo massage. Very receptive, hospitable, very knowledgeable masseuses. Was able to make a last minute appointment the day of. Leaning towards more targeted massage to ease the knots in your body than relaxing and overall satisfied with the service.	Honestly a very good massage place, I was surprised as I thought it might be overpriced as it‚Äôs so central and touristy, but the service was efficient and polite and the massage was really good, using scraping and cupping to enhance. Will be going back here. 	Such an amazing experience! The salon was nice and clean. Super friendly masseuse and customer-oriented. She definitely knew what my body needed. Came out with a whole new body. Highly recommended!!! 	I love this place - my 6th time here. When I come from Switzerland on a business trip I stop here and I go on demand and I have the best massage of my lifeüíÜ ‚Ä¶ 	I originally came to Brussels to travel, but because of the writing of thesis shoulder pain unbearable, just roadside casually find a Chinese medicine massage, I did not expect the effect is simply immediate! The owner's wife is super nice and patient! And the price is the best value for money in the neighbourhood! Highly recommended! ü•∞ ‚Ä¶ 	It was my first visit but by far, the best chinese massage place I've visited in Brussels. Hai Hong is a real therapist,she knows what she is doing and fix what need to fixed. It was a relief for my neck and shoulder. Thank you Hai Hong, 5 stars is not enough for you ! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ	Best massage I have ever had! Hai Hong is the name of the lady who I discovered the first time I went to this salon and since then I never wanted to change the masseuse. She is higly competent, fun and charming. But most importantly - she performs magic with her hands. The first time she massaged me, she made a knot in my neck that I had for years, disappear. In one single session (using the manual technique and the cupping) I higly recommend this salon which I will miss greatly now that I have to leave Brussels.	This was my first time visiting the Massage Chinois. I found the place through Google and it turned out to be an amazing experience! I made an appointment originally for deep tissue massage to relieve the chronic shoulder/neck pain that I have. Hai Hong who was my masseur realized the knot soon she started and decisively recommended that I do cupping and acupuncture treatment because she believed massage alone won't be able to clear the knot. She was correct because I could no longer feel the knot after the treatment. The knot had always been there over the years and many masseurs gave up to work on it (pain was temporarily relieved). So, I am very happy with the outcome. Hai Hong is also very experienced because she accurately pinpointed the problems on my other body parts based on my response to ear and feet massage. So, I strongly recommend her to everyone because she is professional, friendly and genuinely passionate to help people. I will return for sure! 	mom and I are from Thailand. We came to the grand place square, we had the opportunity to massage chinois 168 and we were very impressed. The staff is friendly , she speaks multiple languages. and she massaged very well . After coming for a massage, I felt that the aches and pains were clearly gone. If you have a chance to walk around gland place square, I would recommend you to come to massage chinois 168.
