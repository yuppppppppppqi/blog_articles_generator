The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing, with a soothing scent and soft music that set the perfect mood. The staff was warm and welcoming, making me feel comfortable from the moment I arrived.  I chose the aroma oil massage (lemongrass & eucalyptus), and it was absolutely wonderful. The therapist was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure while using aromatic oils that helped me fully unwind. The combination of gentle strokes and deep relaxation techniques melted away all my stress and tension. After the session, I felt completely refreshed and rejuvenated.  Overall, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-quality Thai massage experience. I will definitely be coming back!	If I can give more than 5 stars I would! The customer service is exceptional! I was looking for a head spa massage to gift for my boyfriend. I reached out to them through Instagram and happy to get a fast and very accomodating response.  They catered to my request of ordering a cake as a birthday gift after the massage and they happily helped me out! They go way beyond and so so happy! As for the ambiance it is very calming and quiet, my bf immediately felt relaxed coming inside. The staff are very nice too! Thank you Erawan Thai massage! üòç 	The atmosphere was good and the spa is clean. Very friendly service and my therapist had very strong hands, however I felt there was a lack of technique and the distribution of time was not even. 85% of it was spent winding 2 knots in my shoulder with her elbows, which really is a shame as the 5 minutes spent on my legs was incredible.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good value for money, as we have had much better massages for a third of the price. 	Perfect relaxation and excellent service!  I had an amazing experience at this massage shop! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing, the staff is extremely friendly and professional. The massage itself was simply perfect ‚Äì the ideal balance between relaxation and deep muscle relief. After the treatment, I felt completely rejuvenated! I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back. Absolutely five stars! 	I had an amazing experience!

I am very happy that the international network is now available in Bankok! The place is very cozy, extremely clean, tidy, the receptionist is very helpful.
