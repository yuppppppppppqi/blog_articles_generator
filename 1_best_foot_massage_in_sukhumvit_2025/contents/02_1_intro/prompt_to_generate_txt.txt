She's well experienced, knowing which part of body needed to take care of, and followed traditional way of Thai massage,  full Thai massage which hardly get from others. I will come back again for Ms Mon. Ms Koe at reception are very patient and friendly to introduce massage available. I strongly recommending this Better Day Healthy Massage center. Cheers to all 😄! 	Amazing Massage – Highly Recommended!  I had an incredible massage at Better Day healthy massage with Nang. The lady at the reception was very helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was relaxing, and the therapist was highly skilled and  attentive. Nang knew exactly how to relieve tension, combining deep pressure with soothing techniques. I left feeling completely refreshed and relaxed. One of the best massages I’ve ever had—definitely coming back!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 	This was a wonderful experience.  I am a married Christian male in Thailand on business and I was nervous about having a massage here in Thailand.  I was worried about all sorts of things going in.  I prayed before I left my hotel room and I was very nervous going in.  When I arrived, I noticed a picture of Jesus above the door in the lobby. (Pictured).  It helped to put me at ease and enjoy my massage.  Tim was gentle and loving in her touch. I very much appreciate her attention.  I would recommend this to anyone. 	It was really wonderful experience. Everyone is so kind and nice. I've got massages by Su and service is perfect. If I visit at Bangkok again, I'm definitely sure to visit here again!	The massage was great! I had some tension in my cervical spine. They relaxed it. They kneaded it. Many thanks to the master Tukta 	My first visit to a massage shop in Novotel It was good that the massager was very professional! Her name is Tukta :) The facilities are clean and it's a little far from the station, but it's nice	We had Man and Mud! Very good massage for our first night! Thank you to the therapist and the host!!  We loved it 	I had an absolutely amazing experience at Better Day, located inside Novotel 20 in Bangkok. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. My massage therapists, Mon and Mud, were truly exceptional—highly skilled, professional, and incredibly attentive to every detail.  Their techniques were outstanding, perfectly balancing relaxation and deep tissue work, leaving me feeling completely refreshed and revitalized. I could tell they genuinely cared about providing the best experience possible.  If you’re looking for top-notch massage therapy in Bangkok, I highly recommend Better Day. Mon and Mud are simply the best! I will definitely be returning on my next visit.	We’ve visited several places for both Thai and aroma massage before coming here and the treatments were divine. The place is clean, employees are super friendly. Our therapists Mon and Tukta provided authentic Thai massage using their whole body. They were well aware of the pressure points and all the knots around my back were resolved. We booked another round of massage immediately after the first one and we will look forward to coming back the next time we visit BKK. Thank you!!🙏🏻	I visit Bangkok every month, and from my experience, I can confidently say this massage shop is the best. The place is clean, peaceful, and reasonably priced. Mon, the therapist, is simply amazing. She seems to know exactly where I need relief even before I mention it, and she focuses on those areas with such care. Her massage is both soothing and invigorating, never painful yet deeply refreshing. I can't wait to visit again! 	Nice experience. Massage shop in 9F in Novotel hotel. Lucky to have Ms. Nammon to be my therapist. Very caring and professional Thai Massage skills. She relieves my low back pain and i have a relax time in Bangkok. 	The massage with Su was absolutely fantastic. She paid great attention to everything we had discussed beforehand. The pressure was just right and very comfortable. I also appreciated that she checked in occasionally to make sure everything was okay, but not too often, which helped maintain a relaxing atmosphere. Overall, it was a very soothing and rejuvenating experience. Highly recommend! 	It was my first Aroma oil massage. Nammon did an amazing Job. The massage was very relaxing and I feel that the tension in my muscles relieved.  Thank you very much for this amazing massage!	Tukta, You are the best. This has been the best massage of my life. Everyone who watches this review is absolutely welcome here. No regrets. Coming again tomorrow. Best Thai massage 	I love the service here. This is my second time here and the Thai massage was just as good as the first time. I like that they ask you what they can or cannot touch, even more important if you have any conditions. I recommend Nammom because she was very careful with me. 	I had a wonderful experience at the Thai massage. The atmosphere was calming, and the service was excellent. It was very relaxing and left me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to unwind	The ladies here were very polite. I got the aroma oil massage for the first time,  it was amazing! I felt refreshed, relaxed and renewed and it definitely drained those lymphatic fluids that I needed gone. Tiktok definitely did her thing❤️‍🔥. Thanks Tiktok.The staff was exceptional and very helpful! … 	The massage shop I chose because I was staying at Novotel was a really good experience. Massage Therapist ‘Nang’ gave me a delicate, powerful and kind massage, and I was so happy for 90 minutes that I could not sleep. The whole facility was neat, clean, and I have already made the next reservation. Anyone near Asok Station must come here. 	Very nice!! The top of thai massage!! Mon gave me a best massage service! I will visit again here if come Bangkok again.	This is not just a massage; it's a healing experience! This is my second visit during the schedule. I highly recommend Tim Nang as the massage therapist!
