Upon arriving, I mentioned to the receptionist that I had neck tension, and my masseuse, Fah, did an outstanding job addressing it—I feel so much better now. The place itself is beautifully designed, with a calm and inviting atmosphere that immediately puts you at ease. I also really appreciated the thoughtful touch of being offered a glass of warm milk before the massage—it was such a comforting start to the experience. Everything was very clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall relaxing vibe. Highly recommend!	Excellent Thai Massage!  Had an amazing massage with P’Am—my body felt so light and relaxed afterward! The place is clean and beautifully decorated. Great service and high standards. Highly recommend!	Really nice place if you are seeking a professional massage services! Staff is very friendly and experienced. 	My husband and I received very relaxing foot massages. This was my first massage ever, and I was completely satisfied with the service, friendliness, and skillfullness of the staff. Would love to come back and will definitely recommend to others! 	1.5h 4 hands massage ended after 1h.  Saw the reviews on this salon on googel and thought it must be good here. The first impression when I got inside the door was good, it felt clean and fresh. the prices are on the higher scale but it felt reasonable as it would be a nicer place. I paid for a 1.5h 4 hands massage session.  Before the massage started i got a glass of tea and a cup of warm milk.  then I went into a room where my feet were washed.  after that we went to the room where i got my massage. I was given clothes to change into, after that the massage began. the minute the massage started I immediately felt that the masseuses did not know what they were doing at all.  they squeezed and kneaded without any special technique.  it was the first time I ever felt that getting a massage was uncomfortable.  The massage therapist doesn't understand English very well so I couldn't communicate with them.  Every minutes felt very long and the only thing I could think of was that I regretted paying for a 1.5h massage.  after an hour they finished the massage.  I knew the time was not up but I didn't say anything to the massage therapists.  I immediately changed into my own clothes and went out to the front desk and asked for a refund because they ended the massage half an hour earlier.  The girl who worked at the front desk looked confused but I told her that I paid 1800 baht and only got 1h massage so I wanted 600 baht back which I got in the end.  they apologized for the mistake but I was just happy because it was a pain to get a massage at this place.  as an apology I was given a coupon for a 30 minute free massage which I threw in the bin later that night. 	Best Thai massage I've ever had! Luxurious yet affordable, incredibly clean, and the staff is super skilled and kind. Highly recommend for a top-notch experience without the high price! 	Dream house was an amazing experience! Perfect for once you land in Thailand after a long flight. Will definitely be returning for another massage during our stay! 	Me and my wife had the aroma oil, full body, one hour treatment. It was one of the best massages we have both had. Peaceful, relaxing, and we both left with less aches! Friendly & relaxing staff, and accommodating to your requests.  Around £30 each for treatment - excellent value.  Highly recommend! 	Very uncomfortable Pulling on my hair. Pinching my ears. When told her I feel painful, made sound like I’m annoying her. First time I wish the 1.5 hour massage finish faster.	This place is very clean and comfortable. The massagist very good and my whole body feel very relax after massage, will recommend to my friends. 	Had an amazing experience with the Thai body massage! Space is calming and relaxing. And the therapist was skilled, providing the perfect balance of pressure. 	An excellent traditional Thai massage in a clean professional environment. My masseuse was very responsive to getting the pressure just right and did a thorough job from head to toe. You get a cup of warm milk beforehand to help relax you and some tea and pineapple afterwards for a truly comprehensive experience. We’ll definitely be back before leaving Bangkok. 	I came here after reading the reviews. The therapists are not very powerful, and the charges are high but not professional at all. It is the worst massage room among many in Bangkok. I will definitely not visit again. The one-hour charge is 1,500 Thai dollars, which is very not worth it. 	Went 2 times in 3 days. Friendly staff, clean, relax environment, skilled masseurs 👍🏻 price is good too, will definitely come back! Thank you! … 	My favorite massage place in Bangkok! 2nd time coming here. I love the staff, very friendly and always accommodating! Bangkok visit is not complete for me without visiting this DREAM HOUSE spa massage. 	Went with my husband and got a great 1.5 hour couples Thai massage. Would go back again! Very clean and relaxing atmosphere. 	One of the best massage places in Bangkok for the price.  I went for a head and shoulder massage and my masseuse was very skilled and knowledgeable. She insisted on knots and adapted her technique and strength based on where my muscles were tight or not. It was a strong massage, slightly painful as I was sore, but I would say just nice.  The place is super clean and modern. The rooms are spacious and the mattress comfortable. There are even tiny luminous dots on the ceiling, mimicking the stars - nice touch. The music playlist is soft classical music. The ambient air smells of aromatic oils.  Overall a great experience.	My family enjoyed ourselves and feel so refreshed after our session. Slightly more premium but worth it for the cleanliness and comfort of the place 	The place is clean and tidy. Reasonably priced.  They surely didn’t skim on the aroma oil and ensure the right amount is used for the massage. Will certainly come back again. 	Was recommended here from a friend who travels to Bangkok frequently. Just off the busy Sukhumvit area in a really accessible location. The facilities were clean modern designed. Reasonably priced and professional friendly staff. The massage was very relaxing and I fell asleep halfway in. Large shower facilities and non-rushed environment. Highly recommended.
