At Senses Massage, they understand this well. I had a 1-hour traditional Thai massage (350 THB). Payment is required in advance, but credit cards are accepted without surcharge, which is a plus. The spa itself is not overly fancy, but clean and welcoming. My masseuse, Polla, was kind, attentive, and thorough, focusing on areas where she sensed tension or weakness rather than just going through routine motions. The result? A genuinely rejuvenating experience. For the quality of service at this price, it‚Äôs an easy recommendation.	The ladies here does a great job, pressure is on point I‚Äôve been coming back for two days. Definitely a great spot for massage! Prices are reasonable as well. 	absolute blessed at this place. got 1hr Thai Massage and 1hr Aroma Oil Massage my body went through a whole reset üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è before catching a flight tomorrow if you‚Äôre looking for a place to relax this is your best choice!!! ps. super thanks to Jen (the therapist) for being so professional ‚Ä¶	Had a great foot massage with Lamyai. Pleasant atmosphere. Clean premises. My wife had a full body massage (name: Pueng) and she tells me it was also great/good/amazing/excellent! I may be back here before my flight ‚úàÔ∏è back to Canada üá®üá¶! ‚Ä¶ 	If you don‚Äôt know anywhere can have fully Thai massage, you must visit this place, which with even you in budget. The whole vibing makes you feel really cozy and you can fully relax in here.	After 27hrs of travel & a mild day of sightseeing the tired body kicked in w/ a few aches & swellings. After being patiently explained the differences between the 2 of interest my masseuse got to work, 1.30h of perfectly pressured massage work & even some deed tissue & stretch at the end. Business is very clean, fresh, & comfortable. When back in area will return & will recommend to those visiting. 	Great massage, reasonable price, friendly staff! 	I had an amazing 1-hour Thai massage with Malee! Their technique was incredible‚Äîperfectly balancing firm pressure with relaxing stretches. I left feeling completely refreshed and tension-free. Malee was professional, attentive, and really skilled at targeting all the right spots. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a rejuvenating experience!‚Äù 	3/5 rates is given because I had a 2 hrs Thai massage at 10 pm but seems like the masseur is tired and I don‚Äôt feel my muscles relax after that although I had ask for more strength in the beginning. 	Very good and and experienced masseuse, able to provide very deep acu-point massage 	Arrived in Bangkok from the UK today feeling tired and exhausted. Had the best foot massage. Staff Are excellent. Thank you. 	100 stars for Mali ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ+++  I got an hour foot massage and came back twice already (I've been here 5 days)!!! This isn't the only place Ive tried but so far its the best! Thorough, clean and easy to communicate. Highly recommend üëå ‚Ä¶ 	My regular go-to massage place, super welcoming staff and great massages for the best price in the area. Nice touches like candles and free water. Clean and hygienic. 	Came here twice and got the 60 Min Thai massage each time. The service is very professional and the massage was phenomenal. Recommend this place. 	My massage was great! Really powerful and on point with good technique. However I‚Äôve noticed that the other reviews stated that it depends on the masseuse you‚Äôre assigned to, out of our party of three, one of us didn‚Äôt have a good session hence the deduction of one star 	Great foot and back massage! Just recently had an experience to have it here, cause it‚Äôs near my condo and have to say that it was great üôèüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Highly skillful foot massage, went to this shop twice in a row, complete relaxation after a long exhausting day. I would highly recommend this place 	Courteous, friendly and great massage ...so good not sure I actually received the full 90mins aroma oil massage as I was dead asleep üòÖ..... Thanks Tal üòä ‚Ä¶ 	the massage is quite average. the masseuse applied the same technique for one hour for foot massage. The lady just massaged the front of the feet, i told her to massage the rear feet muscles and she did it for 2 mins and then went back doing the same. i tried healthy massage opposite to this place twice but that place was fully booked so came here with high expectations after seeing the google review but was unfortunately disappointed.	My favourite place when I want to go for a massage. Am here everytime I am in Bangkok. We have our favourite masseuse - Aum, Wel, Jaeb
