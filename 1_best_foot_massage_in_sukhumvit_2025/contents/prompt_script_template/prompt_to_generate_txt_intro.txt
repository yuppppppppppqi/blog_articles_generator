・Summary:
    - Write a paragraph between 100 and 150 words.
    - Do not exceed or go below this word count.
    - The output should sound natural, conversational, and emotionally genuine, as if written by a real person.
    - Use the reviews as inspiration, but do not copy phrases. Instead, craft personalized highlights that reflect real experiences.
    - The paragraph should read like a summary of overall impressions, without starting with “Summary” or using a bullet point.
    - Count your words carefully. Stay between 100–150 words only.
