Tried the foot massage today and regret not doing the full body. The massage therapist was really good and focused on the pressure points. Definitely coming for the body massage soon. A hidden gem that offers excellent customer service with beautiful done interiors. Also loved the after massage cafe which had some lovely mini treats,  coffee and tea of your choice. Overall I really enjoyed my session today. Definitely coming again. Thank you to the team at Eden.	The service here is phenomenal! Without a doubt, this is the best massage and spa in Bangkok. The staff are incredibly kind, and the facilities are both modern and impeccably clean. It is definitely worth the price for the quality of the service and the experience ur getting.	Words can express how amazing Eden ultimate spa and massage is! When i tell you they great you and treat you like your the only one there is amazing! The massage itself was the best full body massages i ever had! Let me just show some pics!!! 	The massage techniques were very professional, the therapist was attentive, and the environment was clean and pleasant. It was a very relaxing experience‚Äîhighly recommended! 	It was my first Thai massage for 60 minutes. I requested for ‚Äòsoft‚Äô intensity and it was perfect. She also pressed more gently in which I indicated ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô among my body. The atmosphere was also calm, bright, clean and quiet which made it very good to relax before and after the massage. Definitely will go again with friends. 	Omg best Thai massage ever. Even offered free shuttle from Aria hotel. Excellent customer service. Lovely atmosphere. Even got a gift at the end! 	Had an amazing experience at Eden Spa. Highly recommend. Hubby and I did the eden signature body balance. It was very relaxing ‚ò∫Ô∏è Totally worth it!! Ambience and quality of massage were totally worth it!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è 	I just had a full body massage at Eden The Ultimate Spa And Massage Experience, and it was absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by how clean, elegant, and serene the entire facility was. The ambiance set the tone for what turned out to be an incredibly relaxing experience.  The customer service was top-notch‚Äîwarm, professional, and attentive to every detail. They made me feel completely at ease from start to finish. The massage itself was exceptional‚Äîone of the best I‚Äôve ever had. The therapist was highly skilled and intuitive, ensuring the pressure and techniques matched exactly what I needed.  One of the nicest touches was the way they help you unwind afterward. They offer a lovely selection of drinks including coffee, tea, and juice, along with an array of snacks to enjoy while you relax and slowly ease back into the real world. It‚Äôs the kind of thoughtful detail that truly sets them apart.  If you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself or just need a moment of calm, I can‚Äôt recommend Eden enough. It truly lives up to its name. 	Awesome service. The atmosphere was also so relaxing. I actually slept while having my massage here which isn't always the case.  Thanks to all the staff and their hard work! 	Hidden gem SPA with extremely good services. They offer pick up service from Nana station. We had a private roof top all for ourself. The massage pressure was right to the point. I will recommend to my friends if stay around this area. 	Had an excellent spa day here and this was such a great find close to our hotel! We did the ultimate heavenly massage for 4 hours and enjoyed every bit. The staff was welcoming and polite and our masseuse were so good. We will be back before we leave Bangkok! 	Friendly staff, good service for the bus transfer to BTS Nana, a good and relaxing spa environment with a lovely snack bar spot. The masseur has good strength for their job. 	I had a wonderful morning at Eden, glad I walked the 20 mins up here for this experience.  Unlike the run of the mill massage shops that are everywhere here, this one is unique in that they cater to your individual needs.  I liked the quick form you fill out where you can pinpoint which areas of your body need focus, as well as pick the level of pressure.  Then masseuse really nailed my preferences, she was great.  And first class all the way inside, comfortable rooms, beverages and slippers, and after massage snack bar, and exceptional service from the staff.  Would gladly return :) 	Great experienceü•∞ü•∞ Recommended and very courteous, polite and kind personnel. I really appreciate the massage therapist who really gives best effort to deliver her service. Also there are food like teas and coffees they offer after your massage. It was a must try when u visit Thailand. Great facilities, customer service and affordable one. 	Beautiful place and very reasonable prices, lovely people and massage, if you are looking for couples massage this is perfect 	I went to Eden the Ultimate Spa and Massage with my wife, and it was the best massage experience we've ever had. From the moment we walked in, we felt like VIPs. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, and the spa itself was clean and luxurious. We both got foot massages and Thai oil massages, and they were both amazing. The masseuses were skilled and professional, and they really knew how to relax our muscles. We spent two hours at the spa, and it was the best two hours we've spent in Thailand. The spa is so relaxing and peaceful, and we left feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. They also offered us some complimentary snacks and coffee, which was a nice touch. If you're looking for the best massage in Thailand, I highly recommend Eden the Ultimate Spa and Massage. It's worth every penny. 	This place is a real gem, the place was super clean and neat. Very professional & the massager did a wonderful job, I felt so light and relaxed. They also offered a few snacks after the session, a great gesture. 	Respectful Spa that has a menu to suit all ages male and female, the oil massage was one full hour beats any price in the UK, very affordable for me....give it a go you will want to come back again and again. 	The service is very good. We took the aroma therapy massage for couple. They were excellent. Clean and beautiful place. After service is incredible with mini lounge for snack and hot drink.	I had best thai massage ever at Eden Spa on my birthday. Staffs are professional. The room I was accommodated was good. My therapist was great. First time I really enjoyed Thai massage that much. I will come back on next trip to Bangkok.

She's well experienced, knowing which part of body needed to take care of, and followed traditional way of Thai massage,  full Thai massage which hardly get from others. I will come back again for Ms Mon. Ms Koe at reception are very patient and friendly to introduce massage available. I strongly recommending this Better Day Healthy Massage center. Cheers to all üòÑ! 	Amazing Massage ‚Äì Highly Recommended!  I had an incredible massage at Better Day healthy massage with Nang. The lady at the reception was very helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was relaxing, and the therapist was highly skilled and  attentive. Nang knew exactly how to relieve tension, combining deep pressure with soothing techniques. I left feeling completely refreshed and relaxed. One of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîdefinitely coming back!  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 	This was a wonderful experience.  I am a married Christian male in Thailand on business and I was nervous about having a massage here in Thailand.  I was worried about all sorts of things going in.  I prayed before I left my hotel room and I was very nervous going in.  When I arrived, I noticed a picture of Jesus above the door in the lobby. (Pictured).  It helped to put me at ease and enjoy my massage.  Tim was gentle and loving in her touch. I very much appreciate her attention.  I would recommend this to anyone. 	It was really wonderful experience. Everyone is so kind and nice. I've got massages by Su and service is perfect. If I visit at Bangkok again, I'm definitely sure to visit here again!	The massage was great! I had some tension in my cervical spine. They relaxed it. They kneaded it. Many thanks to the master Tukta 	My first visit to a massage shop in Novotel It was good that the massager was very professional! Her name is Tukta :) The facilities are clean and it's a little far from the station, but it's nice	We had Man and Mud! Very good massage for our first night! Thank you to the therapist and the host!!  We loved it 	I had an absolutely amazing experience at Better Day, located inside Novotel 20 in Bangkok. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. My massage therapists, Mon and Mud, were truly exceptional‚Äîhighly skilled, professional, and incredibly attentive to every detail.  Their techniques were outstanding, perfectly balancing relaxation and deep tissue work, leaving me feeling completely refreshed and revitalized. I could tell they genuinely cared about providing the best experience possible.  If you‚Äôre looking for top-notch massage therapy in Bangkok, I highly recommend Better Day. Mon and Mud are simply the best! I will definitely be returning on my next visit.	We‚Äôve visited several places for both Thai and aroma massage before coming here and the treatments were divine. The place is clean, employees are super friendly. Our therapists Mon and Tukta provided authentic Thai massage using their whole body. They were well aware of the pressure points and all the knots around my back were resolved. We booked another round of massage immediately after the first one and we will look forward to coming back the next time we visit BKK. Thank you!!üôèüèª	I visit Bangkok every month, and from my experience, I can confidently say this massage shop is the best. The place is clean, peaceful, and reasonably priced. Mon, the therapist, is simply amazing. She seems to know exactly where I need relief even before I mention it, and she focuses on those areas with such care. Her massage is both soothing and invigorating, never painful yet deeply refreshing. I can't wait to visit again! 	Nice experience. Massage shop in 9F in Novotel hotel. Lucky to have Ms. Nammon to be my therapist. Very caring and professional Thai Massage skills. She relieves my low back pain and i have a relax time in Bangkok. 	The massage with Su was absolutely fantastic. She paid great attention to everything we had discussed beforehand. The pressure was just right and very comfortable. I also appreciated that she checked in occasionally to make sure everything was okay, but not too often, which helped maintain a relaxing atmosphere. Overall, it was a very soothing and rejuvenating experience. Highly recommend! 	It was my first Aroma oil massage. Nammon did an amazing Job. The massage was very relaxing and I feel that the tension in my muscles relieved.  Thank you very much for this amazing massage!	Tukta, You are the best. This has been the best massage of my life. Everyone who watches this review is absolutely welcome here. No regrets. Coming again tomorrow. Best Thai massage 	I love the service here. This is my second time here and the Thai massage was just as good as the first time. I like that they ask you what they can or cannot touch, even more important if you have any conditions. I recommend Nammom because she was very careful with me. 	I had a wonderful experience at the Thai massage. The atmosphere was calming, and the service was excellent. It was very relaxing and left me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to unwind	The ladies here were very polite. I got the aroma oil massage for the first time,  it was amazing! I felt refreshed, relaxed and renewed and it definitely drained those lymphatic fluids that I needed gone. Tiktok definitely did her thing‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•. Thanks Tiktok.The staff was exceptional and very helpful! ‚Ä¶ 	The massage shop I chose because I was staying at Novotel was a really good experience. Massage Therapist ‚ÄòNang‚Äô gave me a delicate, powerful and kind massage, and I was so happy for 90 minutes that I could not sleep. The whole facility was neat, clean, and I have already made the next reservation. Anyone near Asok Station must come here. 	Very nice!! The top of thai massage!! Mon gave me a best massage service! I will visit again here if come Bangkok again.	This is not just a massage; it's a healing experience! This is my second visit during the schedule. I highly recommend Tim Nang as the massage therapist!
One More Thai Massage (Phrom Phong)	4.9	1338	https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE	https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8	<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8' width='600' height='450' style='border:0' allowfullscreen='' loading='lazy' referrerpolicy='no-referrer-when-downgrade'></iframe>	Overall, the massage is good but the deducting point is there‚Äôs no foot washing before the massage, the masseurs merely use wet cloth to clean your feet. I wish this can improve as it‚Äôs the basic! The place is nicely renovated and kept. Receptionist Ms Pim and masseurs Ms Mam and Tar are very nice, polite and always put on smiling face! They are considerate to keep our drink and fruits which we brought to be put into the fridge and returned to us after the massage. That‚Äôs a good service! We have an hour back massage + 15 min back massage with herbal compress ball, also we have an hour Thai massage with herbal compress ball. It‚Äôs very relaxing and it heals our back and shoulder pain with the herbal compress ball. At the end of the massage, we are given the compress ball and to re-use it at home, this is very good as most massage shops don‚Äôt give it to the customer even thought we paid for the compress ball. Another disappointing part is we saw their website promotion advertisement which has a 14% discount from Tues to Thursday and we came on Thursday but after we arrived the shop, we are told that such promotion has ramped down so we are not able to enjoy, hope that the company marketing can revise the website so that the customers are no longer being mislead. I‚Äôll keep my 5 stars to the massage shop for their awesome  service. 	Overall is was an amazing experience! We had the Thai massage+ herbal essence treatment and we were really satisfied with the experience :) The masseuses were very kind, experienced and had an amazing technique! Also, when you arrive in the store, you are welcomed with sweet tea and treats, and once the massage is over they give you the herbal treatment as a gift üòäüëçüèª I really recommend this place :) 	Highly recommend this place. Very clean and quiet. I think many of the massage parlors in Bangkok are located by the roadside and have poor noise insulation. Inevitable you will hear some traffic noise. There was quite minimal if that thankfully (I‚Äôm still reeling from a bad experience at another massage parlor with non stop renovation sounds) The therapist was attentive and strong and tried her best to manipulate my stiff tissues and bones. 	The therapists‚Äô massage skills were average. The terrified was the bed bugs.  We killed one bed bug with blood when we were having our after massage tea with gummy. We faster left the massage place and disinfected our bags and clothes when we returned the hotel.	The massage session simply awesome, i had a relaxed body after that. The environment is good, relaxing and calm. Their service was tip top and accomodating. Will surw back again in future. 	If you‚Äôre searching for the best massage in town, look no further than the serene oasis that combines expert techniques with a soothing ambiance to leave you feeling completely rejuvenated. Hot stone to aromatherapy, their highly skilled therapist like CO2 Aoy, tailor each session to meet your specific needs, ensuring the ultimate relaxation and stress relief. The luxurious spa environment, complete with calming music and aromatic scents, enhances the experience, making it a true escape from the pressures of daily life. Whether you‚Äôre easing muscle tension, recovering from a workout, or simply indulging in self-care, this is the place where your mind and body will thank you. Discover the unparalleled quality and care that have earned this spot its reputation as the town‚Äôs finest massage destination. The tea and jelly at the end was a sweet touch to the relaxing atmosphere. I personally booked through Klook. CO2 Aoy you have a therapeutic touch and relieved my stress from a very long flight! I will be back . 	Quite a decent Thai oil massage experience. The comfort level is quite high but with the price range we are paying, we were expecting a private room with a nicer setting. Recommend booking online in advance. 	You can try to pre-book the massage services online, as you can find some good deals. Otherwise if you walk in, availability may vary and even by paying the full price, I would say it is reasonable.  Masseur was good, you can let them know to reduce strength and they will adjust accordingly.	This was a really good place for Thai Massage. The masseuse was super good at what she does - me with my low pain tolerance, she was able to match my level to make sure I was comfortable enough for the massage (note - Thai massage is not a gentle stroke to help you relax üòÖ). Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped in all the way to us leaving. Worth booking if you are ever in this area üëçüèª Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü 	This is the massage that I have been looking  and wanting for so long. It‚Äôs worth the travel as we stay at Silom. Therapists are all well trained and knows what real massage is. Will be coming back again for sure. Thank you 	loved the convenience of booking my massage via klook - this location did not require me to call after purchasing my voucher and i was able to book directly on klook. price is also competitive!  was surprised there was no feet wash prior to the massage but otherwise the massage was of great quality. this location would not be suitable for those with mobility issues as the rooms are located on the upper floors with rather narrow staircases. the bed was wide and comfortable, the clothes were of good quality (hope they can provide more plus sizes in the future). very happy w my massage and would most likely return :) 	Feel like in the heaven again, you have to try it and bring your family come together 	A wonderful experience. I had Som as my masseuse for my aromatherapy massage. It was definitely one of the top massages I have ever had, and the best massage I had for a long time. She knew where my tired muscles are and worked really hard on them. Thank you so much for the amazing two hours! I will definitely be back. 	Love the place! So clean and beautiful! All therapists are very skilled. I'm impressed every time I come. I've tried every programs and they're all good. I love Thai body massage + herbal compress and oil massages because they use good products. And I am not allergy to products even I have sensitive skin. 	The BEST thai massage! Definitely not something to miss when in Thailand. The service was great and the staff were very accommodating. There's also hot tea and free ice cream taste after the massage. I would definitely come back!! So worth it! üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Very good. We have herbal and thai massage for 60 mins. The massage is great. They even give us the herbal compress ball and a pack of ingredients for tea as gifts. 10/10, definitely will bisit again 	I tried traditional massage with herbal ball massage for 2 hours! Just so nice and the environment made me feel so relax.  Nearby Phrom Phong BTS station, 5-8mins walking distance!	If you‚Äôre looking for authentic thai massage and you prefer medium/strong massage that can have beneficial effects on your body, this would be the place to go. I‚Äôve have already tried a few massage places, and this place by far met my expectations. The reception also assured that I could choose to change my masseuse within 15 mins and that they are all certified annually. Highly recommended to completer your thai experience in BKK 	Clean environment. Professional service. I did a 1h 30min Thai massage. It‚Äôs easy to book and pay online. üôè ‚Ä¶ 	Went to the phrom phrong outlet. Highly recommended, the massage is not painful and it hits you with all the points. I wanted to sleep so badly. The herbal compress is a must do, highly recommended.

The staffs welcomed us with so much warmth and love. The treatment in itself was marvellous. It was so good that both of us snored at some point during the process. They were the very friendly, very communicative, very lovely each and everyone of them. At the end, both me and hubby were surprised by the staff for their thoughts and dedication to making our experience an out of the world one. They offered us a very big bouquet of roses and the most sweetest and cutest of cake ever to celebrate our anniversary. I was over the moon from the whole experience. Looking forward to coming back soon ü©∑ü©∑ü•∞ü•∞  We were asked from the very start of any allergies we have. We were given the choice of aroma we wanted in our massage. Their washroom is so clean. Overall a 100 stars for the whole experience 	We had such a lovely experience at this thai spa called NAKHON. We brought my mother in for a massage, and she came out absolutely glowing ‚Äî she said it was one of the best massages she‚Äôs ever had. The staff were incredibly gentle, respectful, and professional. They took the time to ask about her preferences and made sure she was comfortable throughout the entire session.  While my dad and I waited, the staff offered us complimentary drinks and made us feel very welcome. The waiting area was quiet and cozy and amazing view of Bangkok!  ‚Äî a great place to relax. After my mom finished, they surprised us with free mango sticky rice, which was such a thoughtful and delicious treat.  It wasn‚Äôt just a massage ‚Äî it felt like a full experience of Thai hospitality. You can really tell they care about their guests. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and be treated with genuine warmth. We‚Äôll definitely come back the next time we‚Äôre in Bangkok!	A Memorable Spa Experience at Loft Thai - Nakhon in Bangkok  Today, my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and late honeymoon with a luxurious spa experience at Loft Thai - Nakhon in Bangkok. After thorough research into the countless spa and massage options in the city‚Äîrightfully known as the massage capital of the world‚ÄîI came across glowing reviews for Loft Thai and decided to book their signature Emerald Elephant Elite package for couples. At $700 USD, it was their most comprehensive offering, and we were eager to see if it lived up to the hype.  Our appointment was at 1:00 PM, and from the moment we arrived, the professionalism and warm ambiance of the place exceeded all expectations. Located in a busy part of the city, the exterior initially gave us some doubts, but stepping inside was like entering an oasis of calm. We were warmly greeted, offered a refreshing cold drink, and given an explanation of the products used during the treatments. They carefully asked about any allergies or preferences, adding a personal touch to the experience.  We started by selecting our preferred oils for the massage before being guided to the treatment room. The setup was immaculate and inviting, immediately putting us at ease. After changing into robes, our session began with a 90-minute full-body scrub. It was pure bliss‚ÄîI fell asleep twice during the treatment! Following the scrub, we had a shower and prepared for the massage, which turned out to be the best massage of my life. The skilled hands of the therapists worked wonders, leaving me deeply relaxed and utterly rejuvenated.  The final phase of our package was a facial and skin treatment, which left my skin feeling incredible‚Äîsoft, smooth, and glowing. I lost track of how many times I drifted off during the session, a testament to how relaxing and enjoyable it was.  After the treatments, we were served delicious tea and sweets, a perfect end to the experience. As a thoughtful gesture, the staff presented us with a special honeymoon gift. I must give a special mention to Pan and Cat, the two therapists who looked after us with such care and professionalism. Their expertise and attention to detail made the experience truly unforgettable.  Loft Thai - Nakhon provided an experience I will cherish forever. I now understand why it receives such stellar reviews, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a world-class spa and massage experience in Bangkok.  Thank you, Loft Thai team, for making our special day even more memorable. 	One of the best thai massage experiences I‚Äôve had in Bangkok. From the warm welcome to the treatment itself and the tea in the end, everything went well. Special thanks to miss First for the massage. Definitely more expensive than your random massage parlor on Sukhumvit Road but better value for money. 	OMG! I was blown away by the Deep Tissue (90mins) and Intensive Facial - Aesop Products (60mins), both by masseur Ms. Rin. Walking into the spa being greeted by a gentleman staff (I‚Äôm sorry I forgot your name!) so warmly, it felt like a 5 star hotel spa and indeed they were! I was welcomed by their Detox blue drink whilst the staff chatted with me on the art gallery displaying of local artists artworks next to it. (Love this as a visual artist myself, I applaud them for creating a platform for local talents.)  Don‚Äôt be fooled by the masseur Ms. Rin‚Äôs physique cause she gave me the best massage I‚Äôve had here in BKK! She might be young but she massages like a pro who has been doing this all her life! I was floating in heaven from her medium-hard massage and her facial was simply awesome too! This spa was not far by distance from my hotel but the usual horrendous traffic BKK is known far is something to consider if you can‚Äôt walk to it. But nevertheless no regrets here, because from start to finish I was treated like a queen as you‚Äôre served with a teapot of tea with come local sweets after your massage! Price point wise, they are expensive by local standard but their quality is above and beyond! My experience here was worth every dime! 	I highly recommend the Loft Thai Spa! They offer an excellent services, I‚Äôm very impressed by Loft‚Äôs attention to every single detail, design, customer service, hello and goodbye drinks, high quality products and professional massage therapists. My 2 hours Lavender oil massage was the perfect way to unwind, relax and it was worth every penny. My massage therapist Ms.Nee was very professional, highly skilled, kind and I felt very looked after. Will be back soon! Thank you Loft ! 	A Heavenly Thai Massage Retreat - [LOFT THAI]  Walking into [LOFT THAI], I was instantly charmed by the warm Thai decor and inviting aroma. The staff greeted me with huge smiles, making me feel right at home.  The massage therapists are true pros. Their skillful hands, well-versed in traditional Thai techniques, worked wonders on my tired muscles. Knots I'd carried for ages melted away under their firm yet gentle pressure.  An hour there felt like a mini-vacation for my body and mind. If you're after relaxation and rejuvenation, this place is a must-try! Five stars, hands down! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü 	After few days of holding my pain n decided to come this place because of their good on google review, the staff here very helpful, they help me choose the Sport Massage, which is wonderful, my pain is much more better now. Thank you all of you! Would definitely come back again n they have such a beautiful decoration there. 	One of the best massage ever. Ambiance was very relaxing and great too. Therapist were courteous and good. We had First & Nee, they are both good will be back the next time! ‚ò∫Ô∏è 	I was hesitant to spend so much money on a gentleman's Hydrafacial, but wow what a memorable experience. My therapist Jasmine was amazing, from the moment I walked in the door everything was perfect, the staff were all very friendly and attentive. The facial was unbelievably good, everything Jasmine did was peaceful and done so delicately. It was worth the money and I am now leaving feeling so refreshed and good about myself. 	I‚Äôm here on a last stop for a four month voyage! I came here to Loft Thai reviews! It did not disappoint. You must come here!  Lek give me the best Hydro facial I‚Äôve ever had. It was 90 minutes:  micro dermabrasion, Hydro Facial getting all the junk out, aloe vera serum. She massages you for l10 minutes then there‚Äôs another coconut oil serum, she lifts up your skin with a great fade tool. Next comes the green tea/honey/yogurt face mask with steam. At certain times she massages your head, your neck, your temples. Finally, she washes off the skin, puts another serum on  and sunscreen!  They give Top Class customer service! They served me: hot tea, butterfly cold, tea, and the most amazing little sweet potato and coconut treats. They treated me with kindness and the BEST service! 	I have come to Loftai with Office Syndrome Massarge due to stress and pain in my shoulders. The massage staff is very good, so I can relax and reduce my muscle aches. Good service and location, I recommend and will definitely come back. 	Really lovely and luxurious massage. I chose the lady package included a foot scrub, full body massage and an Aseop facial at the end. For everything it cost ‡∏ø4000. It was very peaceful and relaxing I fell asleep! You get your own private room and there is a shower afterwards as well. The spa itself is very beautiful and aesthetic, it‚Äôs a nice treat to go here! 	Clean massage place. I had a relaxing time with my spouse here at Loft Thai spa, and we throughoutly enjoyed ourself with the Couple Indulgence. 10/10 will be back 	Great ambience and extra friendly staff.  I booked a deep tissue massage and was not disappointed.  The masseuse was highly skilled and worked out tension I was storing in my neck, shoulders, and back.  Ultimately I was relaxed and tension free.  Definitely would do again.  Book early as this location is popular. 	This spa is conveniently located very close to the sky train (BTS), it is a little bit of a walk but not too far. It is located in a small alleyway. It was an absolutely delightful experience. I redeemed a voucher here and I didn‚Äôt realize I had two but the hosts were extremely kind and helpful. They created a really calm and welcoming atmosphere. We were welcomed with some ice cold sweet tea that was perfect because it was sweltering hot outside. They had a quick questionnaire about any problem areas to focus on, strength of massage and what places to avoid. This place is a great place to experience the famous Bangkok Thai massage with the opportunity to add on to your initial package. Had I known about this place earlier in my trip I would have visited a number of times before I left. We were allowed to wind down in the foyer with some traditional Thai rice cakes and hot tea.  Business that take the time to master customer service are businesses bound for success. This is one of those businesses. 	Seriously top class service very professional I went for the Thai Warrior style massage it was excellent . I‚Äôve never really experienced before anything like it before Great ancient authentic technique strong massage not recommended for newbies.  Aesthetic beautiful like Aesop vibes minimal luxury decor very consistent little bit pricey but worth it	Walked in to Loft Thai Spa via google without an appt. Was treated with a very warm welcome by the staff. Managed to arrange a hot compress massage withij 5mins of waiting and also allowed me to take a quick shower before the treatment. The therapist was skilful and I felt so much better from the body aches after the massage. Thank you to the front desk staff who arranged everything so seamlessly! Will definitely come again in future trips to BKk! Highly recommended!	I think I clocked more than 15,000 steps in Bangkok, and carried a lot more than I should so this was much needed.  I did a deep tissue massage and it was just splendid!  I fell in love with their sweet treats too that they serve after!! I just wish I knew what it was cause they were absolutely delish! 	It was an amazing experience at Loft Thai Spa. The ambience is superb and the staff are very friendly. Our massage therapists did a great job at the massages too - we both felt so good after. We‚Äôll definitely be back!

My therapist, Ms. Tim, was incredibly skilled‚Äîshe worked out all my knots and made me feel completely relaxed. The atmosphere was so soothing, and I really appreciated the attention to detail throughout the session.  Honestly, it was one of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had! I left feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the world. I can‚Äôt wait to come back every time I‚Äôm in Bangkok. If you‚Äôre looking for a great spa experience, I highly recommend checking this place out! 	Very nice atmosphere and service. I‚Äôd love to come back here. We all loved it. Thank you so much for ur work. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- I really-visited this same place after I really loved it. However the lady Ive had for the Thai massage had HORRIBLE skills, I had a painful time for 1 1/2hrs. I still have so much pain in my back, legs and arms. I think she doesn‚Äôt know how to massage or maybe she doesn‚Äôt wanna work at all. Also, she left for few mins twice during the massage, didn‚Äôt know why? And she rubbed my skin horribly without any oil or water, i felt so so much irritating on my skin. It was the WORST experience in bangkok. 	Nice and quiet place for relaxation and health massage. My masseuse Kaew and she did a very good Thai massage, relaxing and strong. A cup of herbal tea is served after the massage.	My husband and I were looking for a foot massage and this lovely gem was right around the corner from our hotel. The facilities are clean and warmly lit, music is relaxing, and all staff were very kind and hospitable. The room where the foot massage took place is cozy. Pang (my massage therapist) was very sweet and had even asked if I get cold easily and she offered me a seat where it was warmer. This was my first foot massage and I was scared at first but it felt amazing! Pang was great‚Äî I highly recommend her. I would come again if I ever visit Bangkok again! 	Hidden gem in Bangkok that everyone must try. Highly recommended for those who look for massage with sophisticated skills that relief stress and muscle pain. The price is really cheap compared with those fancy spa, while the quality of massage delivered is beyond our expectation. Highly recommended! 	Finally experienced the long-awaited Thai massage! The masseuse's techniques were professional, the pressure was just right, and my whole body felt completely relaxed. It significantly relieved my shoulder and neck soreness‚Äîhighly recommend it to my friends! 	Don is so good, best forever. Its first time I experience such intense massage. I feel so relexed. I ve been here for 4 times almost everyday I stayed in bankok. My wife also likes here. This place makes us want to stay longer in bankok. 5 star. 	Excellent service, propper traditional Thai massage done by fully trained professionals.. leaves you both relaxed and rejuvinated at the end..  They were happy to accommodate my request to mix 2 massages in to the time I booked. 	Excellent massage. Been going for close to a year now and everything from the foot massage to the full body Thai massage has been perfect. The wife and I do not go anywhere else now that we have found this place. Highly recommend and very affordable for Bangkok near Sukhumvit. 	Have a good good experience in Health Massage. Ms. Pang is a skilled massage therapist, she impressed me with her skill. This is my first time here, and i will be back again in the future üíó ‚Ä¶ 	Visited in weekday afternoon. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. I love the warm welcome from the boss. P‚ÄôPang is my massager, she provided excellent service to me and i really enjoyed the time with her. Definitely worth the money and I will surly visit again. 5 stars! 	The masseuse was really good at foot massage. Room was nice and dark so I could relax on massage chair. Reasonable price and Christian owned business, will definitely come back here for quality service next time! 	I had an extremely relaxing hour and a great body massage here, the price is very cheap compared to the value received, Ms Nanny is so amazing, enthusiastic and thoughtful, i love there 	Reasonable price at 350 baht / 1 hr thai massage, therapist Par has nice strength and technique. Location is a bit distant from BTS. 	Whenever I visit Bangkok, Healthy Massage is at #1 on my list. Today, Jam treated me, and as always, they were professional and friendly. I will definitely be back. 	Best massage in town when you're in Bangkok! Be sure to visit them and have masseuses Fah and Tim work their magic to relax your body. Will definitely visit again next time! 	Tanam and Anya provided very good oil massage for us. It's so relaxing and want to back again.	Today I had a foot massage service with a staff named Noey. She provided excellent service. I would like to recommend her and this massage shop. Thank you so much 	I had an incredible experience at Healthy Massage Sukhumvit 33 in Phrom Phong. From the moment I walked in, the environment was welcoming, clean, and relaxing, setting the perfect mood for a rejuvenating session. The ambiance was calming, with soothing music and a well-maintained space that immediately made me feel at ease.  A special mention to Don, the therapist who worked on me. She is truly a master of her craft‚Äîhighly skilled, intuitive, and attentive. Her technique was precise and effective, ensuring that every pressure point was addressed with the right balance of strength and comfort. What impressed me the most was her ability to make me feel completely at ease while lying face down, adjusting the pillows and positioning with such care that I could fully relax and enjoy the massage without any discomfort.  Her deep tissue work was exceptional, relieving tension and knots without causing unnecessary pain. She also checked in regularly to ensure the pressure was just right, demonstrating her professionalism and experience. I left the session feeling lighter, more refreshed, and completely recharged.  If you're looking for a high-quality massage in Bangkok, I highly recommend Healthy Massage Sukhumvit 33, and if you have the chance, ask for Don‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed! I'll definitely be returning on my next visit. 	One of my best massage! You can trust this place is "real Thai massage" with no hidden agenda. I had head&shoulder and therapist, Khun Leeya was able to fix my issue. Highly recommend.
Loft Thai Spa & Massage - Sukhumvit 38	4.9	940	https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJId0YJVif4jARWDSL7vugeGQ	https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJId0YJVif4jARWDSL7vugeGQ&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8	<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJId0YJVif4jARWDSL7vugeGQ&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8' width='600' height='450' style='border:0' allowfullscreen='' loading='lazy' referrerpolicy='no-referrer-when-downgrade'></iframe>	You can immediately feel the boutique vibes the moment you step in. The interior design blends beautifully with Thai elements, creating a peaceful and calming energy throughout the space.  I was greeted by the receptionist by name before I even introduced myself‚Äînow that‚Äôs impressive. Their warm and friendly welcome made me feel well taken care of before the treatment even began.  The welcome drink was fresh and delicious, the perfect refreshment after walking in from the hot sun. Before the treatment started, everything was explained to me in detail, which really put my mind at ease.  I had a facial treatment this time, and three days later‚Ä¶ wow. My skin has never felt so radiant, smooth, and glowing.  This place is highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself with top-notch service and guaranteed quality. 	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a facial at Loft Thai Spa, Sukhumvit 38 in Bangkok, and it was truly one of the most relaxing and rejuvenating treatments I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was serene and inviting, with refreshing beverages and calming scents setting the perfect mood.  The staff was incredibly professional and attentive, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout the entire session. The facial itself was divine‚Äîmy skin was thoroughly cleansed, exfoliated, and it was feeling refreshed and glowing. The therapist‚Äôs technique was gentle yet effective, and I appreciated the extra care they took to personalize the treatment to my skin type.  I also loved the little details, like the relaxing facial, the complimentary foot massage and the warm tea and snack at the end, which made the experience feel even more luxurious. If anyone in Bangkok and looking for a top-notch spa experience, I highly recommend treating yourself to a facial here. It‚Äôs a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.	A huge thank you to the entire team at Loft Thai Spa! My friend and I had an exceptional experience. The welcome was warm, the place was peaceful, and the massages‚Ä¶ simply amazing. It was both relaxing and rejuvenating. We left feeling calm and happy. Thank you again for your professionalism and kindness. We‚Äôll definitely be back!	Totally exquisite experience from start to finish! I felt so relaxed and happy. I am so thankful to everyone who works here üôè they helped me choose the treatments for my needs, and the therapist who treated me was wonderful, used the perfect pressure and asked for feedback, made me feel very comfortable and was very professional. I have had a lot of foot massages, as I have chronic pain, and the foot massage here is the best ever. So relaxing. I did not want to leave after treatments! I will definitely return many times before I go home üíúüëå‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you to the lovely ladies in the receptionist and to the therapist, I did not get her name but she is fantastic üòç 	Absolutely fantastic experience! The massage was incredibly relaxing and tailored to my needs, relieving tension in all the right areas. The cupping was expertly done, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. The skin treatment was also top-notch, leaving my skin glowing and refreshed. The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire session. I walked out feeling like a new person! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comprehensive and excellent wellness experience. Five stars! 	Found Loft Thai Spa based on highest Google reviews. Some personal background I am a frequent wellness spa junky back home in Kuala Lumpur.  Admittedly nothing beats my personal masseuse who rolls me out knuckles and elbow until I‚Äôm mushed. Not for the faint hearted coz it can be painful but all my kinks will disappear after each session.  So since I‚Äôm on holiday I wanted a more relax feeling but still firm. This place met my wants and needs and the atmosphere + ambience + service was a bonus.  Love the skylight architecture. We went for the Aesop Facial Spa and Lady Spa Package. After each session we were given a lovely tea pot and bite size local delicacies.  Hip hip hoorah to Roxy for being a wonderful host and patiently entertained all our questions. Will definitely return again‚ù§Ô∏è 	I had the best massage of my entire life today!  Me and my friend took very long to decide what kind of massage we want and the receptionist was very patiently waiting and askied if we needed any help.  I have sensitive skin so I asked them to show me the products they use for their facial and they were kind enough to do that.  In the end, I went with 120mins aromatherapy deep tissue oil massage with coconut oil as suggested by them for people with sensitive skin and I left the massage with supple and smooth skin!  The entire massage experience starts with interacting with knowledgeable receptionist about the massages/facial they offer and a refreshing healing butterfly pea tea and hot towel for your hands.  After that, they provide a form for you to write down your massage strength preference, area of focus/avoid. You are then brought to a cozy, dimly lit, room with a private bathroom and outdoor shower for your massage.  The masseuse here clearly has better and more professional technique, it was the right strength to release the tension and knots in my body, I fell asleep briefly because I felt so relaxed during the massage.  You are given shower gel and lotion to shower after if you want to rinse off the oils. The massage experience ends with 3 types of dessert, pandan jelly cake, pumpkin shallots cake and coconut ondeh paired with herbal tea.  Would definitely come back again to treat myself! 	Loft Thai Spa is the must-go spa in Bangkok. You cannot miss this Amazing spa. My family and I visited twice in a week since it's so relaxing and comfortable. Professional massage and service. Big Thank You to Gie and our therapists (Apple and Cherry)! Our sore bodies will miss you all! ü•∞üòÜ	Very nice and clean place. We very very good taken care of and the massage was holistic - from feet to body and head. People are extremely nice and good skilled. The only minus is a bit expensive. 	My friends and I came here because of all the amazing reviews and the facility looks clean. The staff were amazing, welcoming and accommodating. We got the welcome drink and after treatment snacks and tea, but the facial was mediocre. We paid $4800 baht/person, which is equivalent to $140 usd for the hydra-facial. This is considered pricey for Thailand, so we were expecting our face to be clean and glowing afterwards, it was not. The description on their website for the hydra-facial includes ‚Äúextraction‚Äù, upon arrive we were told no manual extraction, the only ‚Äúextraction‚Äù we were getting is from the suctioning of the hydra-facial machine. The facial ‚Äúmassage‚Äù and foot bath felt more like a caress than a massage. My face felt exactly the same after, grimy with black heads and milia. I came back to the hotel and rewashed my face. For the price we paid, we would not go back for mediocre results. I rather pay a little more in America for medical grade hydra-facial where they actually cleanse and extract your pores. 	Had a lovely experience! Went for my first prenatal massage at 16 weeks and the masseuse made sure I was comfortable with sufficient pillows and checked in with me now and then. The massage was comfy with a good amount of pressure! 	It was a great experience. A little pricey but great. Would recommend the half day spa with body scrub, hot stone oil massage and facial 	What an outstanding experience. My husband and I requested the couples indulgence package. It was 3 amazing hours of truly some of the best treatments we have ever received. The esthetics of the spa are tasteful and calming and the service is 5 star quality. Worth the trip. So happy we found them. 	Great place to have a good massage, good facial and a pampering time! The Thai massage was really good and so was the facial. They serve you with a drink before the spa and snacks after. The receptionists speak very good English and reservation can be made easily though WhatsApp as well. Would recommend this place though it‚Äôs more expensive than other Thai massage places but you get a great massage that relieves your knots! 	The staffs were great! I went to treat fatigue and soreness‚Ä¶ I got to relax and alleviate almost all soreness. Great service and tea! 	This spa in Bangkok is truly exceptional! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The masseuses are highly skilled, especially with their pregnancy massage techniques. They even surprised us with a thoughtful gift for our baby, showcasing their commitment to customer care. I wholeheartedly recommend this spa for anyone seeking a top-notch relaxation experience! 	Lovely spa that provides massages and spa treatments with smiles and desserts! On the expensive side but totally worth it if you want to splurge on yourself! 	I had an amazing time with their Thai compress massage program! The complementary snacks and service quality were superb. You can tell after receiving the service that their therapists here are experienced. After the massage, my shoulders and legs pains are gone. I love it. Definitely come back again for their massageüíï  Ps. I recommend you book the appointment in advance, so they can prep everything ready to serve you :) 	Roxy and kitty and Iris were incre√≠ble!!!  What a truly luxurious experience to have a half of a spa day, they made the whole transition seamless into my time in Thailand. If you are ever in Bangkok, you have to go to the Loft.!	One of the most disappointing massage experiences in Thailand. Not only is the music driving someone crazy but they place didn‚Äôt feel welcoming at all. I was left waiting 10 minutes without a drink, didn‚Äôt get a foot bath, the room was too bright and hot and the massage was way below the quality I expected. This is not worth the price at all. For a cheap corner shop massage it‚Äôs okay but not for this experience  Edit: It is clear now why their reviews are so good. After leaving the original review the place emailed me and offered a refund if I delete my comment. Since I believe in transparency that won‚Äôt happen. Clearly this is not the first time and shows that their score should be a lot lower than it currently is.

It cost 500 baht which I think is beyond I expected. I totally fall asleep and really enjoyed it. After the massage there‚Äôs a plate of fruits and veggies rather than sweet mango ü•≠ with rice. I think is great too .  Anyways I will be back again ! Also recommend any of you if you are expecting to have a normal price and great service. 	Amazing Swedish massage üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have ever had!! Omg the lady I had her name is ok ‚úÖ and so I will go back to her because I love the way she was pounding on me!!  It was so so good!! My friend from Canada üá®üá¶ was in and she got the oil aroma therapy and was so happy with her experience as well!  To drop it off to give you a little yogurt yummy dish with fresh fruits in it as a refreshing after massage  and they give you a tea before the massage!  I love the water rubs they bring to wash your feet!! üë£  Hi this place I‚Äôm going back for sure I will get the sweetest massage the  Swedish one and see if I can get one for two hours it was amazing truly it was so good!  OK so my fellow foodies I‚Äôm also gonna share my massage experience - incredible make sure you follow us here as well as social media channels trying to grow our database for new fellow foodies that want to try and experience amazing restaurants in Bangkok!!  üå∏üå∫üå∏üå∫üå∏üå∫üå∏üå∫ü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã 	A small, but well staffed professional massage venue. Therapist K. Pook gave me a Swedish massage with a focus on a stiff/locked shoulder per my request. The massage was good and was highly effective in unlocking my normal range of motion and relaxing my muscles. My wife opted for the hot stone therapy. She enjoyed the massage and said she was very relaxed afterwards.  I highly recommend going here for therapeutic massage.	My first foot and shoulder massage here and I had the therapist Ratsamee. She is so gentle yet skilled in her massage. I had a lot of tension from work but she massaged it all away. The price is also affordable and place is clean and nice. Thank you and hope to come again!	I recently had an aroma massage at Eszence, and it was nothing short of magical. It didn‚Äôt just soothe my body‚Äîit brought a deep sense of inner peace and healing. The care and hospitality I received were truly out of this world. I‚Äôm so grateful for the experience and already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Eszence, for such a soulful touch!üåº‚ù§Ô∏è 	For someone who goes to massages very often i can tell the difference between a good one and one that‚Äôs not really it. If you come for a relaxing massage, very much recommend. The staff is extremely friendly and you get a nice drink as a starter with included information what it‚Äôs good for. At the end you also recieve a nice tea with some fruit and yogurt. Hospitality 10/10. 	This was the far best massage I've ever had in my ENTIRE life ü§Ø K. Arty for me and my mom had Ice. They were not only thorough and so experienced but also nice and caring. We were both sooo satisfied and walked out with big smiles! Wish we found this place earlier so that we could visit twice ü•≤ (and they were also very accommodating and understanding when I had to cancel for the first time due to the heavy traffic on the road!!) 	Great service. So nice and accommodating. You start with a cold tea before your service. I got the office syndrome with oil. Just what I needed after the long plane ride. At the end she cracked my neck and back. Then you finish with a hot tea and yogurt. I'll definitely go back again before I leave. 	Exceptional place! Everyone was so professional and kind, the place was also very clean and relaxing. They served a cold tea at the start, and fruit with yoghurt and a hot tea at the end. I got the office syndrome with oil massage and it was sooo relaxing and just what I needed! Highly recommend 	They served different types of tea (with benefits description) before and after the massage and also ended with a plate of salad. Masseuse was skilled and generally the crew were all super nice! Very pleasant experience! 	This place is amazing and a great service! I had foot scraping and pedicure. They did a fantastic job for make my feet looks natural and more glossy. I‚Äôm impressed with their professional works. Highly recommended! 	My fianc√© and I came here for a herbal oil Thai massage. And in one word it was fantastic! Ja O was really attentive and expert at her craft. Will definitely come back soon! 	It was such a welcoming place and I felt so relaxed. The staff are super sweet and attentive.  Left feeling luxurious and pampered. They have used the space so efficiently. My 1st ever Thai massage and it really lived up to the name. Highly recommend this place. No wonder they have such good ratings. Hope to back the next time I visit Thailand. 	Had a very good aroma massage by senior therapist Ja-O! The massage was firm and so relaxing. I will come back again and again since they accept bookings on Whatsapp. Worth the price! 	I will give zero stars if i could. I wanted to have one hour Thai  massage while the receptionist told me that it is too short for a full body massage so she was kind of pushing me to confirm a 90 minute massage. However, after telling her that I only have one hour before going to the airport she was asking me to book 30 minutes head massage +30 minutes foot massage instead. Which, was almost double the price. Even paying more, I was not having a good experience since the massage was below average and I was getting annoyed at the meantime Funny enough, while I was paying and complaining, the receptionist finally told me that she asked me to book another program was because the bed was fully occupied while I entered the shop. So irresponsible and it was such a waste of time and money 	Wow it‚Äôs fantastic. I got Senior Masseuse Toy and I have never had such a good Thai massage in my life. 90 minutes well spent and everyone was super kind, they let me have a shower, and they gave me a delicious tea in the end. A must try 	Me and my husband said the same idea about this massage experience, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the best massage I‚Äôve had ever!!‚Äù, I thought I tried so much in my life, but this experience was so wonderful, highly recommend‚Ä¶‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 	Professional staff, clean, and calm environment. Nui was an exceptional masseuse. Tea before, after, & a tasty salad after was icing on the cake :) I higly recommend this spa when in Sukhumvit, Bankok! 	I loved every minute of the appointment. Everyone here is so kind, so helpful and always smiling. The atmosphere is very relaxing, really quiet and peaceful. My masseuse Joy was AMAZING! I will definitely come back again! 	Very satisfying experience. Staff members are nice and friendly. My massage was very therapeutic! The massage lady knows well about what she's doing, even though she has almost killed me with the pain!!! üòÜ But I feel like reborn now ü§£ü§£ü§£ ‚Ä¶

New place. Beautiful. Clean and friendly staff. I love this place! 	We went to Thai Thai Massage near our hotel right after our flight, and it was amazing!

Highly recommend for anyone looking to unwind in a clean, calming space with top-notch service! 	We had a very good experience at this massage salon. Very experienced and friendly staff, the place was very clean and great atmosphere. Everything you would hope for going for a traditional Thai massage in Bangkok. Certainly coming back during the holiday and would recommend you do as well.	Great massage.

Had 90mins session and it was fabulous experience. Hope to have more sessions soon. Ambience was amazing and Thank you.	A very neat and calm massage place in sukhumvit.  Much better if you come before 6pm. Fina and nan are very skilled and accomodating. 100% recommend 	Opted for package 4 as I want some tummy massage. For oil massage, u can have a shower after that, but the water is slightly cold for me as I prefer hot shower. Good service from Jane. Cash payment Only. Go b4 6pm for some promo price.

Kwang was my masseuse and she is incredible! Highly recommend this place 10/10! 	legit good. I took aromatic full body 60mins massage. best really. 	Here is a positive review for the THAI THAI Massage parlor in Bangkok, Thailand:  "I had an amazing experience at THAI THAI Massage during my recent visit to Bangkok. The spa is located in a convenient and central part of the city, making it easy to find and access.  Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the friendly staff who provided excellent customer service. They guided me through the check-in process seamlessly and made sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit.  The massage itself was exceptional. The therapists were highly skilled and intuitive, tailoring the massage technique to my specific needs. I opted for a traditional Thai massage and was impressed by how rejuvenated and relaxed I felt afterwards.  The facilities were clean, modern, and well-maintained. The treatment rooms provided a serene and tranquil environment perfect for unwinding.  Overall, I cannot recommend THAI THAI Massage enough. It is the perfect spot to indulge in an authentic Thai massage experience while in Bangkok. I left feeling refreshed, renewed, and will definitely be returning on my next trip to the city." 	Bad luck. My manager's massage skills were terrible. Also, the room wasn't clean and smelly. 	This massage place is suprisingly great. I took the 1 hour door massage with balm + the facial. The result, let's just say that the whole session and the experience is just heaven. For a place that is so touristy, you would imagine a mediocre quality, but I was completely wrong. So yeah, 5 star it is from me then. 	Decided to go for a massage as I was having a bad migraine. I didn‚Äôt mentioned anything but the moment my therapist- Aui massaged my neck and head, she asked if i had a migraine and loosen all the tension. I felt 100% better after the session! Affordable and definitely value for money :)	Amazing scrub and massage! The staff were friendly and the experience was so relaxing. My skin was amazing after the scrub massage! I would definitely come back to this parlour. Very professional and clean. 	The place is so clean and decent. The masseurs is polite and friendly. They are giving you the best message ever and following what kind of level you want. For me, I always go for soft and by far the best. Love this place so very much. Do come visit please you are some nearby. 	The people there was hospitable. The woman who gave me the massage eagerly listened to me so I wasn‚Äôt hurt or disoriented in a way. It‚Äôs a good place to get a massage. It ain‚Äôt 4.9 for nothing, that‚Äôs for sure. üòä Will definitely comeback and recommend.	Best massage ever! So kind and worth it. Very clean and calming music	Very satisfying 1hr oil massage. Good balance of strength and on point. Private clean room with proper massage table. Went there at 3.35pm and got discounted price. A place to go for a proper massage in this a area.

Upon arriving, I mentioned to the receptionist that I had neck tension, and my masseuse, Fah, did an outstanding job addressing it‚ÄîI feel so much better now. The place itself is beautifully designed, with a calm and inviting atmosphere that immediately puts you at ease. I also really appreciated the thoughtful touch of being offered a glass of warm milk before the massage‚Äîit was such a comforting start to the experience. Everything was very clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall relaxing vibe. Highly recommend!	Excellent Thai Massage!  Had an amazing massage with P‚ÄôAm‚Äîmy body felt so light and relaxed afterward! The place is clean and beautifully decorated. Great service and high standards. Highly recommend!	Really nice place if you are seeking a professional massage services! Staff is very friendly and experienced. 	My husband and I received very relaxing foot massages. This was my first massage ever, and I was completely satisfied with the service, friendliness, and skillfullness of the staff. Would love to come back and will definitely recommend to others! 	1.5h 4 hands massage ended after 1h.  Saw the reviews on this salon on googel and thought it must be good here. The first impression when I got inside the door was good, it felt clean and fresh. the prices are on the higher scale but it felt reasonable as it would be a nicer place. I paid for a 1.5h 4 hands massage session.  Before the massage started i got a glass of tea and a cup of warm milk.  then I went into a room where my feet were washed.  after that we went to the room where i got my massage. I was given clothes to change into, after that the massage began. the minute the massage started I immediately felt that the masseuses did not know what they were doing at all.  they squeezed and kneaded without any special technique.  it was the first time I ever felt that getting a massage was uncomfortable.  The massage therapist doesn't understand English very well so I couldn't communicate with them.  Every minutes felt very long and the only thing I could think of was that I regretted paying for a 1.5h massage.  after an hour they finished the massage.  I knew the time was not up but I didn't say anything to the massage therapists.  I immediately changed into my own clothes and went out to the front desk and asked for a refund because they ended the massage half an hour earlier.  The girl who worked at the front desk looked confused but I told her that I paid 1800 baht and only got 1h massage so I wanted 600 baht back which I got in the end.  they apologized for the mistake but I was just happy because it was a pain to get a massage at this place.  as an apology I was given a coupon for a 30 minute free massage which I threw in the bin later that night. 	Best Thai massage I've ever had! Luxurious yet affordable, incredibly clean, and the staff is super skilled and kind. Highly recommend for a top-notch experience without the high price! 	Dream house was an amazing experience! Perfect for once you land in Thailand after a long flight. Will definitely be returning for another massage during our stay! 	Me and my wife had the aroma oil, full body, one hour treatment. It was one of the best massages we have both had. Peaceful, relaxing, and we both left with less aches! Friendly & relaxing staff, and accommodating to your requests.  Around ¬£30 each for treatment - excellent value.  Highly recommend! 	Very uncomfortable Pulling on my hair. Pinching my ears. When told her I feel painful, made sound like I‚Äôm annoying her. First time I wish the 1.5 hour massage finish faster.	This place is very clean and comfortable. The massagist very good and my whole body feel very relax after massage, will recommend to my friends. 	Had an amazing experience with the Thai body massage! Space is calming and relaxing. And the therapist was skilled, providing the perfect balance of pressure. 	An excellent traditional Thai massage in a clean professional environment. My masseuse was very responsive to getting the pressure just right and did a thorough job from head to toe. You get a cup of warm milk beforehand to help relax you and some tea and pineapple afterwards for a truly comprehensive experience. We‚Äôll definitely be back before leaving Bangkok. 	I came here after reading the reviews. The therapists are not very powerful, and the charges are high but not professional at all. It is the worst massage room among many in Bangkok. I will definitely not visit again. The one-hour charge is 1,500 Thai dollars, which is very not worth it. 	Went 2 times in 3 days. Friendly staff, clean, relax environment, skilled masseurs üëçüèª price is good too, will definitely come back! Thank you! ‚Ä¶ 	My favorite massage place in Bangkok! 2nd time coming here. I love the staff, very friendly and always accommodating! Bangkok visit is not complete for me without visiting this DREAM HOUSE spa massage. 	Went with my husband and got a great 1.5 hour couples Thai massage. Would go back again! Very clean and relaxing atmosphere. 	One of the best massage places in Bangkok for the price.  I went for a head and shoulder massage and my masseuse was very skilled and knowledgeable. She insisted on knots and adapted her technique and strength based on where my muscles were tight or not. It was a strong massage, slightly painful as I was sore, but I would say just nice.  The place is super clean and modern. The rooms are spacious and the mattress comfortable. There are even tiny luminous dots on the ceiling, mimicking the stars - nice touch. The music playlist is soft classical music. The ambient air smells of aromatic oils.  Overall a great experience.	My family enjoyed ourselves and feel so refreshed after our session. Slightly more premium but worth it for the cleanliness and comfort of the place 	The place is clean and tidy. Reasonably priced.  They surely didn‚Äôt skim on the aroma oil and ensure the right amount is used for the massage. Will certainly come back again. 	Was recommended here from a friend who travels to Bangkok frequently. Just off the busy Sukhumvit area in a really accessible location. The facilities were clean modern designed. Reasonably priced and professional friendly staff. The massage was very relaxing and I fell asleep halfway in. Large shower facilities and non-rushed environment. Highly recommended.

At Senses Massage, they understand this well. I had a 1-hour traditional Thai massage (350 THB). Payment is required in advance, but credit cards are accepted without surcharge, which is a plus. The spa itself is not overly fancy, but clean and welcoming. My masseuse, Polla, was kind, attentive, and thorough, focusing on areas where she sensed tension or weakness rather than just going through routine motions. The result? A genuinely rejuvenating experience. For the quality of service at this price, it‚Äôs an easy recommendation.	The ladies here does a great job, pressure is on point I‚Äôve been coming back for two days. Definitely a great spot for massage! Prices are reasonable as well. 	absolute blessed at this place. got 1hr Thai Massage and 1hr Aroma Oil Massage my body went through a whole reset üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è before catching a flight tomorrow if you‚Äôre looking for a place to relax this is your best choice!!! ps. super thanks to Jen (the therapist) for being so professional ‚Ä¶	Had a great foot massage with Lamyai. Pleasant atmosphere. Clean premises. My wife had a full body massage (name: Pueng) and she tells me it was also great/good/amazing/excellent! I may be back here before my flight ‚úàÔ∏è back to Canada üá®üá¶! ‚Ä¶ 	If you don‚Äôt know anywhere can have fully Thai massage, you must visit this place, which with even you in budget. The whole vibing makes you feel really cozy and you can fully relax in here.	After 27hrs of travel & a mild day of sightseeing the tired body kicked in w/ a few aches & swellings. After being patiently explained the differences between the 2 of interest my masseuse got to work, 1.30h of perfectly pressured massage work & even some deed tissue & stretch at the end. Business is very clean, fresh, & comfortable. When back in area will return & will recommend to those visiting. 	Great massage, reasonable price, friendly staff! 	I had an amazing 1-hour Thai massage with Malee! Their technique was incredible‚Äîperfectly balancing firm pressure with relaxing stretches. I left feeling completely refreshed and tension-free. Malee was professional, attentive, and really skilled at targeting all the right spots. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a rejuvenating experience!‚Äù 	3/5 rates is given because I had a 2 hrs Thai massage at 10 pm but seems like the masseur is tired and I don‚Äôt feel my muscles relax after that although I had ask for more strength in the beginning. 	Very good and and experienced masseuse, able to provide very deep acu-point massage 	Arrived in Bangkok from the UK today feeling tired and exhausted. Had the best foot massage. Staff Are excellent. Thank you. 	100 stars for Mali ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ+++  I got an hour foot massage and came back twice already (I've been here 5 days)!!! This isn't the only place Ive tried but so far its the best! Thorough, clean and easy to communicate. Highly recommend üëå ‚Ä¶ 	My regular go-to massage place, super welcoming staff and great massages for the best price in the area. Nice touches like candles and free water. Clean and hygienic. 	Came here twice and got the 60 Min Thai massage each time. The service is very professional and the massage was phenomenal. Recommend this place. 	My massage was great! Really powerful and on point with good technique. However I‚Äôve noticed that the other reviews stated that it depends on the masseuse you‚Äôre assigned to, out of our party of three, one of us didn‚Äôt have a good session hence the deduction of one star 	Great foot and back massage! Just recently had an experience to have it here, cause it‚Äôs near my condo and have to say that it was great üôèüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Highly skillful foot massage, went to this shop twice in a row, complete relaxation after a long exhausting day. I would highly recommend this place 	Courteous, friendly and great massage ...so good not sure I actually received the full 90mins aroma oil massage as I was dead asleep üòÖ..... Thanks Tal üòä ‚Ä¶ 	the massage is quite average. the masseuse applied the same technique for one hour for foot massage. The lady just massaged the front of the feet, i told her to massage the rear feet muscles and she did it for 2 mins and then went back doing the same. i tried healthy massage opposite to this place twice but that place was fully booked so came here with high expectations after seeing the google review but was unfortunately disappointed.	My favourite place when I want to go for a massage. Am here everytime I am in Bangkok. We have our favourite masseuse - Aum, Wel, Jaeb
