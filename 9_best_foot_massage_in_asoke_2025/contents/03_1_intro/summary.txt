Often called a <strong><u>hidden gem</u></strong>, this spa wins praise for its <strong><u>cozy, serene ambiance</u></strong> and <strong><u>extremely professional, friendly English-speaking staff</u></strong>. What makes it stand out are its unique treatments, like the Herbal Ground Signature massage and organic facials using fresh, locally-made products – people rave about feeling refreshed and getting a 'baby skin' glow. Therapists like <strong><u>Nut are noted for skillful work</u></strong>, especially targeting office syndrome with firm pressure. The <strong><u>attention to detail</u></strong>, including pre-massage consultations and post-treatment tea, adds to the personalized feel. While the lack of private rooms and one mention of a potentially rough scrub are noted, the overall <strong><u>impression is highly positive</u></strong>. (130 words)
