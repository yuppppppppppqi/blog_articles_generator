No nonsense, <strong><u>great massage</u></strong>. Masseuse <strong><u>Khun Duong</u></strong> got knots out. Professional and sharp.
<strong><u>Very clean and skill professional</u></strong>! Highly recommended for a quality massage experience.
<strong><u>Literally a paradise place</u></strong>! Kind owner, staff, reasonable price, good quality oil.
Service felt less attentive as a Thai customer compared to foreigners nearby.
A bit more expensive than others on the road, but more private.
