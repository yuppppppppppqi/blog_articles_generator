One More Thai Massage (Phrom Phong)
・Rating: 4.9
・Price: Mid-range, often considered <strong><u>good value</u></strong>, especially with online deals.
・Recommended for: Guests seeking a clean, serene environment with skilled therapists and thoughtful service, particularly those interested in Thai massage with herbal compress. Good for those booking via Klook, but less suitable for individuals with mobility limitations.
People really seem to love the clean and quiet vibe here, often mentioning how nicely renovated it feels. Therapists like <strong><u>Ms. Mam, Tar, and CO2 Aoy get shoutouts for being polite, skilled, and really attentive</u></strong>. Many found the massages deeply relaxing, especially the Thai massage with herbal compress – and <strong><u>you even get to take the compress ball home</u></strong>, which feels like a lovely bonus. The <strong><u>customer service sounds excellent</u></strong> too, with staff going the extra mile. Booking through Klook seems easy. Just keep in mind, some mentioned no foot wash beforehand and website deals might be outdated. Also, the narrow stairs could be tricky if you have trouble getting around.
