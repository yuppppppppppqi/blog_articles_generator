Totally fell asleep during my foot massage, <strong><u>really enjoyed it</u></strong>! Great normal price and service.
<strong><u>Amazing Swedish massage</u></strong>! The lady pounded on me, it was <strong><u>so so good</u></strong>!
Therapist <strong><u>K. Pook gave a good Swedish massage</u></strong>, highly effective in unlocking my stiff shoulder.
Therapist <strong><u>Ratsamee was gentle yet skilled</u></strong>, massaged tension away. Affordable and clean place.
<strong><u>Great service</u></strong>, nice and accommodating. Office syndrome massage was just what I needed.
<strong><u>Very pleasant experience</u></strong>! Skilled masseuse, super nice crew, lovely teas and salad treat.
Foot scraping and pedicure were fantastic! <strong><u>Impressed with their professional work</u></strong>. Highly recommended!
Herbal oil Thai massage was fantastic! <strong><u>Ja O was attentive and expert</u></strong>. Will return!
Massage was very therapeutic, but painful at times! Felt reborn afterward though.
Hospitality was great with tea and snacks, but the massage itself was just average for me.
