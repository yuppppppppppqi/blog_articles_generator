My therapist, <strong><u>Ms. Tim, was incredibly skilled</u></strong> and worked out all my knots. Amazing!
Nice and quiet place. <strong><u>Masseuse Kaew gave a very good Thai massage</u></strong>, relaxing and strong.
A <strong><u>hidden gem with sophisticated skills</u></strong> that relieve stress. <strong><u>Cheap price, quality beyond expectation</u></strong>!
<strong><u>Masseuse techniques were professional</u></strong>, pressure just right. Felt completely relaxed afterward.
<strong><u>Excellent service</u></strong>, proper traditional Thai massage by trained professionals. Felt relaxed and rejuvenated.
<strong><u>Excellent massage</u></strong>, perfect every time. Won't go anywhere else now. Highly recommend!
<strong><u>P'Pang provided excellent service</u></strong>, really enjoyed the time. Definitely <strong><u>worth the money</u></strong>!
<strong><u>Therapist Pang was great</u></strong>, very sweet and accommodating. Highly recommend her!
Massage skills felt a bit inconsistent this time, unfortunately left with some pain.
Therapist rubbed skin quite hard without oil, felt irritating afterward.
