The foot massage was incredibly relaxing and soothing. The therapist was attentive and skilled, focusing on all the right pressure points. The atmosphere was calm and serene, with soft lighting and peaceful music, making it the perfect escape from daily stress. My feet felt revitalized and pampered, and I left feeling completely rejuvenated. Highly recommend this spa for anyone in need of a relaxing and therapeutic foot massage! 	Tried their healing foot massage for one hour and it's worth spending my time for! Their therapist really has a soft and light hand for the massage. I really felt so relaxed from beginning to end. After the foot massage, they will also briefly give you stretching and shoulder massage, which will complete the whole relaxing experience. For only 750 baht, this is really worth your money! I will definitely go back for their service again. 	Extraordinary massage ever!!  I recently visited KLINIQ Spa, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The moment I walked in, I was welcomed by a calming atmosphere with a clean and modern design that instantly made me feel relaxed.  The massage was absolutely outstanding‚Äîone of the best I‚Äôve ever had! The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and focused on my specific needs. Every movement felt purposeful, leaving me completely rejuvenated by the end of the session.  The spa itself was spotless, with great attention to hygiene, which added to the overall sense of comfort. The serene ambiance, soothing music, and subtle aromatherapy scents created the perfect environment for relaxation.  If you‚Äôre looking for a spa that combines professionalism, cleanliness, and a truly relaxing experience, KLINIQ Spa is the place to go. I can‚Äôt wait to return! 	Highly recommended! This is the best spa in this area. I tried signature massage 1.5hr with khun Mas she is amazing! After the massage, they have complimentary mango sticky rice. Really delicious! 	Let‚Äôs relax then beyond relaxation !!! This place is provide an incredible amazingly massage experienced. Yes, besides the quality of product they use but the masseuses they actually professional and certified. I have received the oil massage from them first time, and I love it!!!!!!!!! This place deserves more than 5 stars from me !!!!! 	I had a great experience at this placeÔºÅWe found this spa after shopping in the siam square, quite and private. The staffs are super nice and well considered üëçüèªDefinitely will come again! ‚Ä¶ 	This was an incredible massage! Every single muscle is feeling relaxed and rejuvenated! The last of my 9-day trip to Bangkok, and what a way to say good y to beautiful Thailand and its beautiful people! I was so tense from walking and sightseeing these past few days. I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed this. I feel brand new and ready to do it all over again! The facility was clean, high-end and very professional. It was so posh! I enjoyed a purple lemonade of some sort before my massage and I‚Äôm sad because I know I can only get it here! I had a mango and purple sticky rice upon completion of my massage, and it was so delicious and pretty! I promise to come back to Thailand and visit KLINIQ again. It was the highlight of my trip! 	I had a relaxing massage at Kliniq, gifted to me recently. The atmosphere was calm and inviting and the therapist was highly skilled and attentive. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I would highly recommend. 	Did Thai massage and facial KuaSa here! . The ambiance was soothing, making it the perfect place to unwind. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quality self-care experience! 	I recently visited a brand-new spa located in the heart of Bangkok, and I had the chance to try their gua sha body massage‚Äîand I can honestly say it was an unforgettable experience.  Gua sha, an ancient Chinese therapy, uses smooth stones or tools to scrape the skin gently, which stimulates circulation and helps to release built-up tension in the muscles. During my session, the therapist applied just the right amount of pressure, making sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment. The technique is excellent for relieving muscle soreness, improving blood flow, and even promoting lymphatic drainage. After the massage, I felt a noticeable sense of lightness and relaxation in my body, as if all the stress had melted away.  The spa itself was tranquil, with soothing music and a peaceful ambiance that added to the overall relaxation. The therapist was skilled and attentive, making sure to focus on my problem areas while maintaining a gentle and therapeutic approach.  If you‚Äôre looking to try something different or if you‚Äôre dealing with tension or muscle fatigue, I highly recommend this gua sha body massage. It‚Äôs a unique and effective way to relax and revitalize. I‚Äôll definitely be returning to this spa for more treatments in the future! 	The first impression is nice. Staff at reception is polite and serve us welcome drinks upon arrival and I think the nice part will just end here. Took a 1 hr 30 mins package which include 1 hrs thai massage and 30 mins foot massage. It is my first time to experience Thai massage on a reclining couch used for foot massage which is totally uncomfortable.  No clothes were given to change and masseur were pretty restless. Will definitely go for other spa as there are many other options in Bangkok. 	Great spa experience in the heart of Siam Square. I try Gua Sha face massage today and it was really good treatment, my face feeling so fresh & clean after treatment. 	Luxurious feeling, clean and upscale spa. My husband got a foot massage here while I got my nails done across the hall at Morning Kiss. Great spa experience! 	I had the guasha treatment  The staff were amazingly hospitable, welcoming and professional. The therapy was super relaxing, the massage was great. Most surprising of all was the mango sticky rice they provided at the end that was super delectable.  Would highly recommend this. 	Amazing place with spacious, clean and well maintained rooms. Comes with the option to shower if you opt for their oil massage as well.  Was surprised that their bed has heating function which was amazing + the mango sticky rice dessert that was given after the massage. 10/10 would recommend if you‚Äôre nearby the area. 	I revisited Kliniq Wellness Spa at their Siam Square One branch on the 6th floor. The location is very convenient, as it‚Äôs near the BTS, making it easy to access. I had a 60 mins foot massage with the therapist, Kulamad, who provided a relaxing experience with the perfect amount of pressure to relieve stress and tension. I highly recommend Kliniq Wellness Spa for anyone looking for a convenient and professional spa experience. 	The therapist used smooth, flowing strokes with just the right amount of pressure. It was clear they were experienced and knew exactly how to work out the tension in my muscles, especially in my neck and shoulders.

The pressure is right and comfortable and my masseuse was very attentive. When my toes cramped during the massage, she immediately applied a hot towel to my foot and massaged it to relieve the tension. My friends also praised the experience, saying it was very relaxing. 	We live in India and travel a lot to the far east My wife and I love massages The last time we were in Thailand for 15 nights We made it a point to try a different massage parlour each time But on this trip to Thailand , we discovered this massage parlour I got a massage at the hands of  Dountdee. I found her to be very effective She had good technique and was willing to give me a different intensity of foot massage Some customers like a light massage, whereas others may prefer a medium or high intensity massage Doundtee did a great job On my last three days in Bangkok, I came here thrice I have made up my mind every time I come here I‚Äôm going to come to the same parlour and if Doundtee Is available I will always use her services The rates are the same as everywhere else So why not come to a place where the masseur He is willing to make an extra effort  Great experience. Dountdee very very good  Lek strong lady. Strong hands	Was a bit cautious of all the 5-star ratings from many people with few other Google reviews, but this place was great. It‚Äôs in a row with 4-5 other massage places, each trying to sell their services as you walk by. Arun Piti seemed to have a better ambiance, and inside was calm, relaxing music, and a small fountain splashing gently. I got a foot and lower leg massage from Wan, while my wife got a full-body Thai massage. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed it. Perfect pressure, finding knots we didn‚Äôt know we had. Other guests also seemed very happy with the service based on their ‚ÄúOMG that feels good‚Äù-groans and expressions. Prices are also very good for the service. If we‚Äôre in MBK area again, we‚Äôll be back! 	My wife and I went there at 9:30pm not knowing that the place closes at 10pm. However, the masseurs obliging completed their service without any short cuts or rushing us and they paid attention to detail to unravel the knots in my wife's legs. Got to speak to the husband of the owner and he was hospitable and friendly. I will recommend to anyone who wants a reasonable priced massage with good service! 	I had a wonderful foot massage by a young man. It was one of the best I had in Thailand after visiting and staying in more than 10 places all over the country. The less one star is because I had a bad headache a few hours later, which might(!) have happened because of his touching at the back of my neck. Either than that, as you can see, the place was packed and full. And yet, super quiet. Khob Khun Kha. üôèüòä 	Great relaxation in the MBK center. The staff is professional and helpful. Massage prices are affordable. The Arun Piti space is located on the fifth floor near the central escalator.	Absolutely amazing experience at Arun Piti Thai Massage! The ambiance is relaxing, the staff is professional, and the service is top-notch. A special shoutout to Khun Cake‚Äîtruly incredible and extremely experienced. Their technique is exceptional, and they know exactly how to release tension and relieve stress. I left feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a high-quality massage in Bangkok! 	Tried this 5 star massage at MBK center.  Ms Apple assisted me and IT WAS THE BEST massage i had in my life.  I swear this shop knows what a "massage" is. Get the neck, shoulder, back with oil for very tired and aching back and shoulders.  Worth every penny.  Don't forget. Look for Ms Apple 	Amazing. I have had about 8 massages here and every one amazing. The staff are wonderfully caring and extremely skilful and always seem to be happy in their workplace. The shop is spotless and smells amazing. I wish I could take you all home with me! Cannot recommend this place enough for all Thai massage. 	Amazing massage! Best Thai massage I‚Äôve ever had. The therapists are highly skilled :) I left feeling completely refreshed. Highly recommend! 	Visiting Thailand for the second time, had Thai Massage in many places but here was the BEST one. The masseuse ZeZa surprised me and made my body happy and stretched! Also what is important is that  they speak English, even though it‚Äôs basic they understand you what makes it easy to communicate. The owner was there as well and we had a nice talk! Will definitely come again! 	Ignore the other massage shops on the way. This is the best with good price value. The male masseuse was super friendly and always smiling. Tipping them is a pleasure 	We were received at once,all 8 of us and got wonderful and relaxing foot massage. The light was dimmed,place was tranquil so I really enjoyed this time. In another places is normally very noisy and therapists like to chat with each other. I love Arun piti place and I sincerely recommend it! 	I highly recommend this massage shop! Every therapist is skilled, but I particularly want to highlight Mr. Phet, whose expertise is exceptional. If you're seeking a quality massage, this is definitely the place to visit. 	I visited 6 times during my 2 week trip to Bangkok and was completely satisfied every time. Compared to other massage shops located in the same building, Arun Piti's prices are very reasonable and the quality is never lacking, so I had no reason to look for other shops. The foot massage is highly recommended, and the 30-minute head massage is more than perfect! The therapists are friendly and considerate, and the shop atmosphere is calm. Once you visit, you'll immediately understand why their Google rating is so high. Additionally my young daughter loved massages here as they are great with children. I recommend Arun Piti to anyone traveling to Bangkok and I will come back again on my next visit to Bangkok :) 	First time here for massage and I totally enjoy it! You must look for Meaw who is a very experienced masseur. Must come for massage if you are staying in Siam area 	It was an amazing experience. The atmosphere was relaxing, and the staff was professional and welcoming. The massage was tailored to my needs, helped relieve tension and stress. I highly recommend their services to anyone looking for a high-quality massage!

From the moment I walked in, I was met with a warm and calming atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. The staff is not only professional but truly caring, taking the time to understand my needs and tailor the massage accordingly.  The skill and expertise of the therapists are outstanding‚Äîthey intuitively know how to release tension and restore balance, leaving me feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. Every detail, from the soothing ambiance to the attentive service, reflects their dedication to holistic healing.  If you‚Äôre looking for a place that goes beyond just a massage and truly cares about your well-being, Nature Thai Massage is the perfect choice. I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next visit! 	Went here for massage and received such a pleasant welcome. Very polite and professional. Always been here each time I come to Thailand. Massage was great and very nice. I am pleased! 	***Shop gives out free gifts for 5 stars reviews on tripadvisor***  I personally find it quite rare to pay first before the service. I asked for a male masseur but I ended up got a female one who was not entirely professional.  Throughout the massage, her strength was not consistent and sometimes I felt like she was just barely touching here and there. If I closed my eyes she would use even less strength. So I had to open my eyes and play with my phone the whole time so she would not dare to get too relaxed and lazy.  There are other cheaper options in the area to try out. 	We had a fantastic traditional Thai dry massage two years ago and the quality has remained great when we returned for a dry back and shoulders massage tonight. Recommend this place - clean, AC and therapists with a lot of strength. 	Since a tremendous experience that I came here almost everyday during my time in Bangkok and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. The body massage with hot herbal press was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep immediately. The masseuse were always consistent each time I‚Äôm here. Definitely a must go the next time I‚Äôm here in Bangkok. Thank you! 	Explore a new massage place at Siam Square Soi 5 . Called Nature Thai Massage , not bad services. I took the 5 in 1 therapy! Feel relax and nice!must go visit next time! 	Went for the traditional Thai massage, they had an offer on so did the 90 minute one instead of 60 minutes. Accept cash and card - for card payment, will have 4% charge. It was really nice and peaceful, got given tea and biscuits afterwards as well. The staff members were lovely and polite, definitely recommend this place! 	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the 5 in 1 therapy massage at Nature Thai Massage.  From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. The atmosphere is calming, and the therapists truly know their craft. Each technique used was tailored to my needs, leaving me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.  A huge thank you to Nong and Nok for their exceptional services and professionalism.  If you‚Äôre looking for a great and relaxing massage, look no further! I highly recommend visiting Nature Thai Massage. You won't be disappointed! 	The best massage I‚Äôve had in Bangkok so far! Staff are all lovely, especially Jum and Joy, who put in a lot of care and effort into their work. We will definitely be returning! :) 	The massage was relaxing and refreshing , the ladies who assisted us were kind and friendly. Their English was good which made it easier to communicate about what we prefer . 	One of the best massages i‚Äôve ever had . Definitely worth visiting here again!!!! strongly recommend Jum, she has the strength and really help me relieve my muscle pains. Thank you very much! 	Nature Thai massage is truly amazing. If you are trying to heal, destress, or find relief, this is one of the best massage spots in Thailand. The staff are very skilled, attentive, and very kind. The price is excellent for the excellent quality massage. I highly recommend, 6/5 stars!! 	Love it ! Our return for the 5-1 massage at the same shop ü•∞..  Visit shop before 5pm get 20% discount ! üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Lovely massage in Bangkok. Staff are friendly and the massage is well priced. We have been back twice now! Recommend üòä ‚Ä¶ 	Massage therapy was great and I enjoyed such a unique experience here at Nature Thai Massage. Aroma Stress Relief Massage was amazing! There was product that they use with you that you couldn‚Äôt find in any other massage place! : ) highly recommended 	Very relaxing massage done and the masseuse is very professional. Definitely recommend you to come here and try. 	Decided to get their deep sleep massage (Indian head massage + aromatic stress release). It was a mediocre body massage, felt like the masseuse was just going through the motions. The Indian head massage was rubbish; it is not even a real Indian head massage. I think they need to tell customers that your hair will be covered in tons of oil. I would have rather a normal head massage than this ‚ÄúIndian head massage‚Äù which is just hair pulling. The lady even told us we may not be able to pay by card as they might reach their limit for the day?? And so we should pay by cash‚Ä¶ I said I had no cash and only card and the transaction went through

The 90minutes foot massage was magnificient, I fell asleep, and my legs recovered from sourness. Massage staff name is Ya, very professional. I will visit again.ü§ó ‚Ä¶ 	We enjoyed a one and a half hour Thai Traditional massage here. The experience was wonderful, with a friendly reception welcoming us upon arrival. The room was clean and had a quiet setting, making for a relaxing and rejuvenating massage. Thank you very much!üôèüèªüòä ‚Ä¶ 	I paid 650 for 90 min. It‚Äôs clean and relatively new inside. A bit cramped even and the first floor. Massage was good and soothing but she was light even though I ask for more strength. Nothing outstanding but they accommodated all 5 of us without an appointment. Average I would say but with Thai massage, even the nicest place with a bad masseuse can ruin the experience. I just didn‚Äôt have a good one here. If you like one, note her name and keep going back to her. That‚Äôs how you do it. 	A good massage place to go to. The masseur really massaged out the tension and knots in my shoulders. The environment was also really amazing - one of the best I've been to! Zen and relaxing. 	Best massage in Thalian so far!  Staff are friendly and experienced and salon is very clean.  Highly recommend 	It was such a great experience to book a massage at Pela Thai Massage to cap off your Thailand trip. They treated me really well! I enjoyed my pampering session. They had modern facilities and expert therapist. I‚Äôll be back on my next Thailand trip! 	Very good massage. Very friendly staff, nice and clean places. Very recomended üëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 	Amazing Thai Massage place! Booked for the 5 of us (via Klook) and reservation was seamless. The Staff were very accommodating and friendly. The lady who did my massage was very strong and friendly and made us tea afterwards.  Would highly recommend. üôÇ 	This is a very relaxing massage and spa place. The facilities are so nice and look like Japanese style. The massage helps me relaxed my muscles a lot. I would recommend this place. 	I've been traveling for 20+ days so my body was entirely hurting specially my feet, after this massage I feel good as new. The service was amazing, everyone is really nice, the music and the smells are really soothing. It was the best massage I've ever had! 100% recommended. 	Excellent massage and service! Booked for 3 people and the receptionist was able to accommodate us. I purchased the Pela Signature Relax package. Without having to explain, the masseuse was able to identify problem areas quickly and loosen up the tension. The space is clean, relaxing, and welcoming. Highly recommend and will definitely return for more massages! 	Awesome service! Very nice and clean environment. Although it‚Äôs a bit pricier but it‚Äôs worth the price.  Brought my baby along and did the 6 in 1 therapy and it was so comfortable. The other lady came out to help me take care of my baby while I enjoy my massage which I greatly appreciate. ü•∞ü•∞ 	Relaxing massage and totally enjoyed it. Opted for the aromatic massage, 90mins with 1 for 1 promotion at 1,650 baht which is definitely a steal! Place was clean and quiet as well. Highly recommended. 	Wonderful experience!!!! All the service are good, the massages will keep confirming you are ok or notüëç Definitely will come back again!! ‚Ä¶ 	Truly amazing massage. They are dedicated to giving the best massage experience. Just a warning for foreigners. It will hurt during it, but afterwards you will feel amazing and relaxed. 	Comfortable and new environment. Massage was great! Would come back 	Super place!!! My husband and I did the "Aromatherapy oil massage with herbal compress" 60min and it was super nice!!. Worth it 100%. All the people was very nice and they offered us a hot th√© after the massage. The girl on the front desk was very kind and helpful (her name was Jane). ;)

The place is neat and clean. Massage was comfortable so I come here again today, on Saturday night(I spent 40 mins from far away just for to come back to this same place). However, there are lots of customers on Saturday night, we need to wait for a bit and then the man on the front desk get me really mad. I says I expect a massage that focus more on head, because last time when I came, the lady said the head bundle will focus more on the head. But this man didn‚Äôt hear what I‚Äôm saying at all, he is keep talking and keep yelling at me that there is no massage bundle will focus on head only(The main point is he keep saying when I was explaining what I want‚ÄºÔ∏èThat‚Äôs why I feel disrespectful ). I said I totally understand there won‚Äôt be a head only massage. But this man didn‚Äôt hear to me at all, which piss me off and get me so mad. I felt I didn‚Äôt get respected so I decided to leave. Very disappointed at this store and never come back. I was supposed to recommend this store in social media but now I won‚Äôt. 	Had a 2 hour body scrub and aromatherapy massage by Korn (lovely Thai lady) it was extremely relaxing. It was also nice to be able to pick out the oil and scrub myself. She did an excellent job scrubbing off all my peeling skin from a nasty sunburn two weeks ago. The massage was also amazing and she even cracked my back at the end and released a lot of tension. She also gave me a nice tea and desert to end the session. I will definitely come back here the next time I‚Äôm in Bangkok again! 	I chose this Nikko by searching Google Reviews. This place is nice, soothing ambiance , with reasonable price. Their selection is flexible can have several add on also. I went with 120mins foot and Thai traditional massage. Nong Din is my masseur. He has good at stretching. Felt relieved after massage. Recommended! 	I had an incredible Thai foot massage, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the experience!  The therapist YOK was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension without causing discomfort. They paid close attention to problem areas, my feet felt lighter, and the soreness I had from walking all day was completely gone. I also loved how the massage included gentle stretches and kneading up to the calves, which made a huge difference in improving circulation and overall relaxation.  The place was clean, the staff was friendly, and the prices were reasonable for the quality of service provided. I left feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to unwind after a long day. 	First time here and because of the reviews I decided to give it a try. I think it's more like a hit and miss feeling when doing the oil foot massage. My foot therapist Ratch's strength is inconsistent, most of the time doesn't hit the spot. She focus on my feet to toe alot unless I requested to focus more on my thigh. Secondly the towel that was given to cover my legs makes me feel itchy.. However, she did very well for my neck and shoulder without oil. The overall experience, I feel that maybe some therapist can do better without oil, might not be because they are inexperienced. Although the experience did not make me rest during the one hour session..and I actually thought for the price and experience I don't think I will come back again but after the neck and shoulders experience I might give it another chance to try the traditional Thai massage without oil. It's kinda mixture feeling. 	I recommend this place!!  The staff very friendly, the massage clinic is very clean with modern interior design.  Today I had hand , shoulder and head massage. It was amazing , I enjoyed every second and didn‚Äôt want it to end. I feel very relaxed and will be visiting this place again. 	Very good experience. Skillful therapeutist. Recommended hot stones massage for shoulder and back.Just next to Siam one square, nearby is Inter Restaurants since 1981, "niko and..."  and Gentlewoman shop. 	I had such a great experience here! My masseuse Art did a great job at working out the knots in my shoulders during my traditional Thai massage. The "around the world" move he did at the end got me all the way together. The Thai tea custard we were served at the end was delicious as well! 	Clean and comfortable place for a massage by senior experience masseur/masseuse. Overall happy with the experience in a dimly lit room with soft music in the background.  NOTE: If you are paying with credit card, please note that it will incur additional 3%. 	The price is not cheap, the environment is OK! The clothes are clean and smell free! Friendly service! Volunteered to tip! 	Amazing massage, Maew was very sweet and put me at ease making me very relaxed. The after-massage tea and new snack was a delicious Thai tea custard. I felt very relaxed, will come back again the next time I'm in Thailand. 	Enjoyed my massage with Polla. Her massage was very good and made me feel  relaxed. The strength was just right! Her attitude and service are exceptionally great as well. Will definitely come back for her massage again. There was a small little snack provided after the massage. 	Found this place accidentally while walking around Siam Square late at night. Had a good massage, friendly staff and good treatment. End up came here 2 nights in a row. Clean area & open till late night! 	3.5 stars. The massage was alright for me, but my companions loved it. I personally felt that the masseur focused too much on the calves during the foot massage. Do note that if you pay by card or QR code (e.g. alipay), there'll be an extra 3% charge. 	I opted for the foot + neck shoulder massage. Yok was so good at it then I fell asleep! Will totally request for him again when I come back. Highly recommend! 	A good and proper massage place that pays attention to peace, silence and appropriate strength throughout the whole experience. They are beautifully furnished, very clean and zen vibe.  There‚Äôs a foot washing service for everyone regardless of the massage you choose. And their staff are really gentle and professional, they literally work and talk less.  The rooms and environment is very clean and you can see the whole place being very well-maintained. And they make sure everything is done properly, even down to placing a flower petal next to a cup of tea they serve you at the end of the service.  A place in central bangkok with good massage standards and better pricing amongst its competitors. Even the toilets are clean and odour free. 	I wanted to visit the nearby Let‚Äôs Relax but it was fully booked and didn‚Äôt have capacity for any walk-ins. Thankful to have found this place just nearby. They had immediate availability.  I opted for the 2h traditional Thai massage (THB 900) in a private room (THB 120/hr). The masseuse started off by washing my feet with soap and I was given a pair of slippers to wear inside. We then proceeded to the massage area. I enjoyed my massage, special thanks to Khun Daeng who was thoughtful and skilful. She accommodated to my requests and was patient and respectful. The room was also spacious and had relaxing spa music playing in the background.  After the massage I was served a cup of tea and small snack, which was a nice touch. The premises also has its own washrooms which are clean.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will recommend this place!  P.S. Cash and credit cards (+3%) are accepted here.

I‚Äôve been traveling from Japan, Korea, and now to Thailand. My feet hurt, my back hurts & was in desperate need of a massage. I love a lot of pressure and boy did they deliver. I went with a Thai massage no oil for 60 mins. By far on the top best 3 massages I‚Äôve had. Experienced in pressure points. Planning to come back!  They took me as a walk in and I was grateful. You should try to make an appointment if you know your schedule. Easy to find, go up the elevator to the spa floor level 6.  They take Amex credit card yay! There is a 3% fee but no biggie Pricing all available before deciding  The staff speaks English well No trouble communicating  Pricing is so good and reasonable  Highly recommend 	Everyone was really kind and patient to explain in detail. the masseurs were professional and constantly ensuring that we were at top relaxing condition. Definitely worth every penny n time. Will be back when i visit bangkok again. 	Good experience. Staff are very friendly. choose for the 4hr Rose and Champagne couple spa. Package started with scrub , follow by aromatherapy massage then facial and bath. Will back again when visit to Bangkok 	I had the 120min hot oil massage and it was amazing.

A great experience üëåüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Nice ambience, clean environment. Staff are very friendly and smiley. Went for the 4h Rose and Champagne couple spa. Started with scrub then aromatherapy massage followed by facial then bath. Gifted me with a gift bag and birthday cake, knowing it‚Äôs my birthday today. Appreciative of their special arrangements. Will be back! 	This spa was recommended by the hotel we are staying at.  Staff speaks good English, I booked two services -- 2hrs aroma oil massage plus a 90-minute spa hair treatment.  The service did not start on time, but I wasn't in a hurry  The staff is excellent in her skill, very friendly, and kept checking on me if the pressure was right and if everything was to my liking.  The head spa was extremely relaxing  The whole place is clean and easy to locate -- take the first elevator from the entrance facing Siam Paragon, go up to the 6th floor, and the spa is right there. They run many specials, so be sure to check out their website! 	Had a wonderful aromatherapy massage at Treasure Spa. The space is calming, beautifully designed, and the staff were friendly and professional. My therapist was excellent ‚Äî the pressure was perfect, and the rose oil added a lovely touch. It was the perfect way to unwind after a day in Bangkok. Great value for the quality.

If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing, high-quality spa experience right in the heart of the city, this is the place to go! 	Absolutely beautiful experience! The Thai massage was top-notch‚Äîdeeply relaxing and expertly done. The place itself is nice, clean, and has a serene atmosphere that makes you feel at peace the moment you walk in. The masseuses are highly skilled professionals who know exactly how to melt away tension. Without a doubt, we‚Äôll be coming back for more! 	Excellent massage service in a calm & elegant place. Cooperative staff and my experience is so amazing! My husband and I have booked a couple massage in the same room. Both the relaxation and Thai massages were satisfying. And the staff served us a relaxing hot drink after finishing the massage. Thank You for making my holiday at Thailand so special. :) 	This is a very nice place and I enjoyed the massage here very much. Thank you for relieving me and the special photo gift! 	Calming environment on the 6th floor of Siam Square One. Before starting you are asked which areas you'd like to focus on as well as the intensity of massage you'd like. My masseuse had powerful hands throughout my two hour massage, very impressive. 	1The atmosphere at this spa is incredibly relaxing, and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure a perfect experience. I‚Äôve never felt more rejuvenated! The treatments were top-notch, and the attention to detail was exceptional.

My masseuse was both firm and gentle, striking the perfect balance. My foot massage even came with a complimentary back and shoulder massage, which was a lovely surprise. Wrapped it all up with a soothing cup of tea‚Äîsuch a great experience! 	Love this place and we always come back here when we are in BKK. Currently there is a welcome coconut drink if you visit between 11am-5pm. The massage here is comfortable and the environment is feels great. 	Was a very pleasant experience! Obviously not the cheapest place you can go, but being a block away from where I‚Äôm staying at the Moxy and how great the staff is, I would come back again.  Included with the price with came a welcome coconut to drink out of (coconut only from 11am-5pm), and a tea and biscuit afterwards.	Had the most incredible Thai oil massage by V. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of massages over the years but this was by far the most detail oriented, intuitive one ‚Äî V got so many cracks out of my back and neck! I feel like i have a brand new spine! 	Amazing experience I got today. I am glad I gave up my thought to go for any other massage parlour and came here for the Office Syndrome Massage. It was a breathtaking experience. The masseuse was too good. I could never imagine they can be so professional! God bless her! May this place keep growing and providing it's services as today. Cannot express more in words. They're too good. 	The store delivered value at the cost of privacy & space. No online reservation. Payment was required upon the f2f booking. My massage therapist was not bad, but was simply pressing me at times (1hr full body). Give it a try, maybe it‚Äôd work for you. 	One of the best Thai Massage in BKK!  So relaxing and the service was amazing I Highly recommended 	Pok was amazing. The foot massage was so relaxing that I slept during the procedure. Good pressure and knowledge of all pressure points was the key‚Ä¶highly recommend. 	That'a my first time doing massage at Bangkok, and i'm fall in love at the first Try üòç the therapist is very good, i'm handle by therepist name Sood-Jai n my mom be mrs Yoya, mr. Sood - jai is an expert the massage is hard because my muscle very stiff but i dont feel pain at all , its really a nice experience to massage at City Of Massage because the massage really good, u must try it because after u massage here all ur fatigue from shoping will be disaapear like magic üòÅ 	Fantastic experience. Good price, clean and bright environment, staffs are courteous and polite. Massage skills also very good. Def will come back again! 	I had a fantastic one-hour foot massage with V, and I couldn't be more satisfied! From the moment the session began, V displayed great professionalism and skill, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension while ensuring a deeply relaxing experience.  The massage was both therapeutic and rejuvenating‚ÄîV clearly understands how to target pressure points effectively. I left feeling completely refreshed, with lighter, more relaxed feet. The ambiance was also calming, adding to the overall enjoyment of the session.  If you're looking for a skilled and attentive therapist, I highly recommend booking a session with V. I'll definitely be back for another session soon! 	Came across this place by chance and the overall experience for me was a pleasant one. I was a bit doubtful at first as the ‚Äúroom‚Äù they brought me to for 60 mins Thai massage was covered by curtains only, but I truly enjoyed the massage (I heard the receptionist pronouncing the masseur‚Äôs name as Nhong & wrote her name in Thai for me). I love how she spent time to massage areas like shoulders & back - where I usually have stiff muscle due to bad posture and her strength is on-point.  Will definitely return the next time I visit Bangkok. 	Pok pok's service is very good, his approach is friendly and kind. Try it once you will get satisfied. 	My son and I went for foot massage and it was really good. Specially the one who massage me. I asked for strong massage and he really did good. Will come back again soon . My massage guy name V thank you V 	I have been here a few times for the past two visits to Bangkok. They are professional and friendly.  Today, I had V (masseuse name), and he did a pretty good job massaging my feet. He is crafty with his skills and would check on me if I am enjoying the session or not.	Low key think this place is a scam. Place is not relaxing one bit, massuese feels overworked, mine had barely energy left in her, I had to ask her to take it up several notches. I said I wanted to change my massuese and she did not allow me to. Pricey for what it‚Äôs worth. I would look elsewhere, bigger chains such as Lek.  Avoid the seat at the end. Worst seat ever. Not a comfortable experience and not the standard experience. Please do not get fooled.  Would not be back or will recommend to friends. 	Has to be one of the best places to get a foot massage in Bangkok! I went to a few other places but City of Massage was just something else. From the atmosphere to the masseuse. V gave me an hour long foot massage that left me rejuvenated for the rest of my trip. If you‚Äôre visiting Bangkok and looking for a foot massage, look no further!

I went for the aromatherapy massage for 90 mins and my masseur was pretty good (especially if you like massages with lots of strength put into them). I do feel that their body oil is way too oily though. A companion of mine felt that their experience wasn't that good though, so I guess it's largely luck-based.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return as I just think that spending a bit more to get a much better experience is more worth it. 	Highly recommend: Signature 5 in 1 massage,  we so enjoy with the full body relaxable time here!	We had a siamese full body aromatherapy massage for TBH1,590 (90min). My masseur was exceptionally good at massaging the knots out of my shoulders but for other parts she was so-so. I thought it was a little weird how my masseur didn't wash my feet before the massage but I guess that's their protocol because my companions also experienced the same. My masseur could have benefited from being a little more refined though; for example, instead of gently lifting the cloth off my eyes, she just yanked it off. Also, she yanked the cloth off my chest without any warning, and I admit I was a bit shocked when that happened. All in all, it was still alright though, thus the 4 stars! 	Was looking forward to a massage so we took the 5in1 package. But we were so disappointed.  Inconsistent strength. Inexperienced masseur and masseuse. All 3 of us got the same thoughts Not worth the dollar. One of the worst massage I ever experienced in Bangkok. Definitely not coming back again.  One more star for them because they gave us immediate slot when we walkin without reservation during public holiday at 8.30pm.	it‚Äôs my first time to get Thai massage in Thailand and it was the best massage I got so far. Looking forward to coming back here. Staffs and therapist are very friendly. will recommend this place. :) 	Very good massage, 2 hours herbal stone was great. Very good choice. Extremely friendly staff 	Had the signature 5 in 1 massage. Highly recommended! Only downside is the 1st floor room is not soundproof so even though the room is very quiet, I could hear the noise in the reception area which is just beside the room. Oh & also everyone walking by can see you, so it‚Äôs not that private :/  Can only use prompt pay & cash!	Great location and real easy to find. Very comfortable place to have a relaxing stay. Booking 90-min foot massage - a great choice if you have a long-distance shopping walk. Also we have hot tea after the massage which is very sweet. 	Shop was clean and staff were nice people. Three of us had for the massage and all three were very satisfied. It was an hour-long massage , but the treatment was very thorough. I‚Äôll back soon. 	Very good massage. The shop is beautiful and clean. The price is reasonable for the location.  Highly recommended.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò ‚Ä¶ 	This is good place. You‚Äôll find the prices. It‚Äôs a little more higher, but they providing extra therapy and extra massaging technique. 	Great massage at a reasonable price, with a nice clean environment. Service is good too! 	The best 90mins Thai massage ever!! Miss Ta literally healed meü•πüôèüèæ Thank you so much for such a great experience and your hospitality. See you again üòç ‚Ä¶ 	I had a stunning 90 mins massage here. The staff is very friendly, recommended! 	I visited Thai Thai Massage at Siam twice in June 2023 for a neck, back, and foot massage, as well as a foot massage. The ambiance was calming, and the massages were relaxing. Arriving early is recommended to secure a spot before it gets crowded after 9 o'clock. Overall, a pleasant experience deserving of four stars. 	The best massage I had throughout the trip (and we visited several massage places!). If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it was our last day in Thailand, I would definitely come back. What I really like is that you have the choice to add 15 minutes of a hot herbal compress or Thai balm if you‚Äôd like. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing; I actually fell asleep during the massage. You can request the intensity of the massage, depending on how hard you prefer it to be. 	the best massage in Thailand! Had a good and relaxing time. Definitely will come back again!

The atmosphere inside the shop is very beautiful and the service of the shop is very good. I got a private room, which is really suitable for relaxation. The room is very large and very clean. You can get a massage as a couple and there is a bathroom inside. You can take a shower before the massage and it is very comfortable. There are also clothes to change for the massage. As for the massage, the massage shop's crew is very professional and the massage skills are very good. It makes me feel relaxed. Most importantly, the shop's crew is very professional, safe and makes us worry-free throughout the massage. There are both male and female crews in the shop. You can choose. Let you feel comfortable and relaxed during the massage. And enjoy the smell of aroma oils. There are many scents to choose from before receiving the service. After the massage, I felt more comfortable than ever. It was the best. And finally, there is a herbal drink and a little snack after the massage. After leaving the shop, I felt more comfortable than ever and was very impressed. Everything that happened here was like heaven. I recommend that you spend at least 2 hours for the best comfort. You should come and try this shop for yourself. You will not be disappointed. And you will find comfort like never before. And of course, I will definitely come back. 	It was an absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish. The ambiance of the spa is incredibly calming, with soft lighting, soothing music, and a clean, relaxing environment.  The therapists are highly skilled and attentive, ensuring the perfect pressure and technique throughout the session. I opted for a Aromatic Stress Release Massage (2 hours), and it was one of the best I've ever had‚Äîthoroughly rejuvenating and left me feeling refreshed and energized.  The staff were warm and welcoming, offering tea after the session, which added a lovely touch to the overall experience. The pricing was very reasonable for the quality of service provided, making it an excellent value for money.  If you're looking for a place to unwind and truly relax, I highly recommend Nature. It‚Äôs a must-visit if you're in Bangkok! 	I was planing to have Thai massage since I have arrived to Thailand, and today chose this place, and no regrets at all. Very clean, professional and cozy place. Massage therapists are very friendly and high professionals. Highly recommended. They also have some welcome treatments and after massage nice tea and some sweets. All in all I‚Äôm satisfied. If you visit Bangkok, just take the metro to Siam Station, it‚Äôs very near to it. 	Great massage ‚Äî very relaxing and professional. The therapist was skilled, listened to what I needed, and worked out all the tension. I felt amazing afterward. Highly recommend! 	One of the best experiences I had in Thailand. Truly amazing, from very moment you enter until you exit. Strong, professional and really nice personal. 	Great service! I felt so relaxed after my massage. The jasmine scent also smelled amazing. Thank you so much! 	I recently had an amazing foot massage! The atmosphere was relaxing, and the therapist knew exactly how to relieve my tension. My feet felt rejuvenated, and I left feeling so much better. Highly recommend it for some pampering! 	I'm so satisfied with the service. Booked the 5 in 1 massage for 90 minutes for reasonable price. The masseuse lady was strong and professional. Receptionist lady was so friendly. The room was spacious and private. Everything was clean and smelled really nice. They provide complementary drink and snack before and after service. 10/10. Recommended. 	Came for the Four Hands facial and foot massage (60min total but two people attend to you simultaneously) as was short on time. Massage rly hit the spot after long day of walking and facial was satisfactory. Paid 2,190 baht (S$80+) 	One of our favorite Thai massage place in the Siam area, it offers a green ambiance and nice aroma. The masseurs consistently provide satisfying service, I always liked to get the signature Thai and herbal ball massages. The place provided a 20% discount if you arrive before 5pm. I highly recommend booking ahead of time as it's conveniently located in Siam and can get busy. The front desk lady communicates fluently in English, Thai, and Chinese, always providing friendly service. The massage rooms are simply set up and consistently clean with a pleasant aroma that enhances the overall experience.	If you are looking for a real Thai massage experience, come to Nature Thai.  A super Affordable and quality massage. Deep tissue and after a lot of walking and sight seeing my feet feel all better.  The staff are incredibly friendly and sweet. Made me laugh a few times too. Come and bring your friends to impress them lol  You get tasty tea and coconut cookies at the end too 	I had a very great experience here. Definitely one of the best thai massage experiences in my life. Great location, Excellent service and reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!!! 	I booked a happy hour to get 20% off on the aroma massage today. The place is definitely on a higher price point, but the experience was worth it. You get a nice drink both before and after the massage. The place smells really nice, so you get into the full relax experience. The only one thing that disappointed me was the masseur wasn‚Äôt as skillful as I expected. She gave me a very relaxing time but didnt work on all the trigger point. 	Is my 1st time for Aroma Oil massage, feel nice and comfortable. Clean environment. 	Was served by a bob cut elderly lady for a 5-in-one therapy 1 hour.  Leg massage was decent. With attention to toe and feet pressure points. But the neck and back massage was one of the better ones I've ever had!  Small issue I had with the store was that the music had a high pitch sound due to the aux cable. They managed to adjust it after awhile.  Highly recommend! 	Nice place, very relaxing and massuers are polite. I had a good 90mins massage! 	A very pleasant experience. The service is top-notch and the facilities are clean and fragrant.

The therapist was really amazing.the massage was so good that I fell asleep and even snored! I really loved it and will definitely come back next time.‚Äù 	1 ‚≠êÔ∏è for lathering moisturiser on my leg sparingly otherwise nope none.  My Fianc√© and I were 5 mins late for our slot and when we arrived and the manager treated us like we were some criminal ‚ÄúThe 2 staff waiting for you. You 5 minutes late‚Äù and slams the clock towards us.  Said we needed to use the toilet and the staff did not provide any specific directions other than ‚Äúthere!‚Äù pointing to the door. Through the door, there were 3-4 massage cubicles? Felt like I was walking into Narnia.  Came out it was close to 5.10pm? And I guess they had to fast forward my 1 hour slot into 45 mins? The masseuse rinsed and washed my leg very unwillingly. During the massage, my Fianc√©‚Äôs masseuse went in at a slow and relaxing pace while mine felt like she was rushing to make a million pastry dough.  Went out and realise everyone had their bags stored beside the counter while we were instructed to keep our bags with ourselves üôÇ  So if you‚Äôre looking for a place to make your blood boil, do visit this massage place. Totally not worth the money.	More people need to know about this place! The TLDR ‚Äî cheap and good!!!!  Masseuse Aoi was extremely skilled and I felt so relieved after the massage. We opted for 90mins traditional Thai massage and felt super relaxed throughout. Many options for massage in Thailand but this is one that didn‚Äôt disappoint, didn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg and was 100% satisfying. Will be back for sure!  Update: Went back the second time and I‚Äôm glad to share that the quality remained the same!	Staff are honest.I remove my old eyelashes and the staff told mi my real eyelashes are weak even redo oso won't last long.. end up my girl do the manicure.. this is the nice hardwork from them.. will definitely come back next trip 	We had an incredible foot massage here, and it was exactly what we needed after a long day of walking. The experience was super relaxing from start to finish.  It begins with a careful and thorough cleaning of your feet, which immediately sets a soothing tone. Then, you‚Äôre guided to a dark and quiet room with soft, relaxing music playing in the background. The ambiance is perfect for unwinding, and the armchairs are so comfortable it‚Äôs almost impossible not to drift off to sleep.  The massage itself was excellent‚Äîjust the right amount of pressure to relieve tension without being uncomfortable. It left us feeling refreshed and re-energized.  On top of that, the service was great, and the price was very reasonable for the quality offered.  This is definitely a must-visit spot if you‚Äôre looking to relax and pamper yourself. Highly recommended! 	It was really great and calm. I did fell asleep for a while. It wasn‚Äôt too cold nor hot. Everything was perfect. Fantastic massage. The tea after the massage was romantic and lovely. 	Have a family of 5 (2 elderly and 3 adults including me). Got unlucky to have customer that was snoring beside us. Thought the masseuse could have done better to make the place a more pleasant for other customers. Reason i give 1/5, only i feel that my masseuse was good. Being very honest here. Kinda unbelievable for the ratings that it was given. Very disappointed as i was the one that introduced this to my family. Will never come back again. Probably try other places. 	Came here first time for massage in Oct 2024 and recently again for a pedicure. Really love the service here with great and helpful staffs. Price is reasonable and their service is üíØ would recommend and will patronise whenever I travel to Bangkok‚ù§Ô∏è 	I really like this Thai massage place. I saw it while having food & drinks at ü•¶ Revolution across the street. It is very convenient to get to it after having some nutrients. It's so good because there are some organic stores on the ground floor, you climb the stairs to get your feet washed consciously and thoroughly. I tried the herbal padding massage today, and it was a bit hot at times but relaxing. You climb one more floor and you get to see an ice bath for soothing and relaxing the body; on the same floor you get to see a co-working station for digital nomads. If you're a smoker, you would have to go to the very top floor for that. 	Good massage, there was a little bit of a wait (10 minutes) and it's on the 3rd floor but they have free wifi. The foot, neck, shoulder, and head massage was super relaxing and the chairs are very comfortable. The ambience is nice and the music is very calming. 	Edit (June 2024): Changed my rating from a 3 star to a 4 star because I went for another round of body massage and foot massage. The masseur this time was skilled and massaged all the muscle knots out of my body.  Previous review: There were two ends to the spectrum regarding the rating for this place. One companion and I felt that this was very average and leaned more towards 2.5 stars, but my two other companions felt that this was fantastic and kept coming back. I went for a full body massage, foot massage and shoulder massage by two masseurs.  For the full body massage, I felt that the masseur didn't exert enough force in the right areas and somehow managed to miss all the sore spots. As for the foot massage, I suspect that the masseur was new, so she kept focusing on the calves; I had to tell her to stop doing that and to focus on the feet. Also, what she did for the right foot, she didn't do for the left foot, so it felt a little lopsided e.g. she would massage a certain pattern on the right foot but forgot about it when she did the left foot. She was great at shoulder massage though, which was a pleasant surprise.  This place is really popular with tourists and their business is good. Book in advance if you'd like to secure a slot. 	Amazing 5 star experience in the heart of Siam. Good pricing too - 500baht for 1.5 hours flew by just like that. Recommended! Will visit again! 	Found this massage place after the damage that C-19 has brought to the world‚Ä¶ not many massage shops left at the siam area, the remaining ones can‚Äôt be bothered with you at all. I randomly walked into Napar Massage and got myself booked for a 60 min foot massage. tidy and clean environment (at least the waiting area)  I had a masseur who didn‚Äôt use much strength at first seems like she‚Äôs just applying massage oil on me.. so I told her to put in a bit more strength and she did, but I felt she did not use consistent strength throughout. 	Had one of the best massages here. The staff is very courteous and professional. You'll have so many options to choose from. Ideally should reserve as it tends to be booked out. Overall a very good experience. 	Sub-par oil massage at an average price. You‚Äôre paying more for the environment which is admittedly nicer than the average street shop . For oil massage 2 pax there is a couple room which a separating curtain if you like to use it. They provide disposable undies. 	I had a very bad experience at Napar Massage in Bangkok. During the session, the therapist kept massaging the same spot with excessive pressure, despite it feeling uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt realize the extent of the damage until I returned to my hotel, only to find my skin bruised and injured (photo attached). A massage should be relaxing, not painful and harmful. The lack of proper technique and care from the staff is unacceptable. I do not recommend this place to anyone looking for a safe and professional massage experience. 	I had a whole body oil massage by Loma. It was amazing. I‚Äôd definitely come back and most definitely recommend it.
