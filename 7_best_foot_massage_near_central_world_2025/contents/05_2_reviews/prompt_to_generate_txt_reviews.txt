The place is neat and clean. Massage was comfortable so I come here again today, on Saturday night(I spent 40 mins from far away just for to come back to this same place). However, there are lots of customers on Saturday night, we need to wait for a bit and then the man on the front desk get me really mad. I says I expect a massage that focus more on head, because last time when I came, the lady said the head bundle will focus more on the head. But this man didn’t hear what I’m saying at all, he is keep talking and keep yelling at me that there is no massage bundle will focus on head only(The main point is he keep saying when I was explaining what I want‼️That’s why I feel disrespectful ). I said I totally understand there won’t be a head only massage. But this man didn’t hear to me at all, which piss me off and get me so mad. I felt I didn’t get respected so I decided to leave. Very disappointed at this store and never come back. I was supposed to recommend this store in social media but now I won’t. 	Had a 2 hour body scrub and aromatherapy massage by Korn (lovely Thai lady) it was extremely relaxing. It was also nice to be able to pick out the oil and scrub myself. She did an excellent job scrubbing off all my peeling skin from a nasty sunburn two weeks ago. The massage was also amazing and she even cracked my back at the end and released a lot of tension. She also gave me a nice tea and desert to end the session. I will definitely come back here the next time I’m in Bangkok again! 	I chose this Nikko by searching Google Reviews. This place is nice, soothing ambiance , with reasonable price. Their selection is flexible can have several add on also. I went with 120mins foot and Thai traditional massage. Nong Din is my masseur. He has good at stretching. Felt relieved after massage. Recommended! 	I had an incredible Thai foot massage, and I couldn’t be happier with the experience!  The therapist YOK was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension without causing discomfort. They paid close attention to problem areas, my feet felt lighter, and the soreness I had from walking all day was completely gone. I also loved how the massage included gentle stretches and kneading up to the calves, which made a huge difference in improving circulation and overall relaxation.  The place was clean, the staff was friendly, and the prices were reasonable for the quality of service provided. I left feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to unwind after a long day. 	First time here and because of the reviews I decided to give it a try. I think it's more like a hit and miss feeling when doing the oil foot massage. My foot therapist Ratch's strength is inconsistent, most of the time doesn't hit the spot. She focus on my feet to toe alot unless I requested to focus more on my thigh. Secondly the towel that was given to cover my legs makes me feel itchy.. However, she did very well for my neck and shoulder without oil. The overall experience, I feel that maybe some therapist can do better without oil, might not be because they are inexperienced. Although the experience did not make me rest during the one hour session..and I actually thought for the price and experience I don't think I will come back again but after the neck and shoulders experience I might give it another chance to try the traditional Thai massage without oil. It's kinda mixture feeling. 	I recommend this place!!  The staff very friendly, the massage clinic is very clean with modern interior design.  Today I had hand , shoulder and head massage. It was amazing , I enjoyed every second and didn’t want it to end. I feel very relaxed and will be visiting this place again. 	Very good experience. Skillful therapeutist. Recommended hot stones massage for shoulder and back.Just next to Siam one square, nearby is Inter Restaurants since 1981, "niko and..."  and Gentlewoman shop. 	I had such a great experience here! My masseuse Art did a great job at working out the knots in my shoulders during my traditional Thai massage. The "around the world" move he did at the end got me all the way together. The Thai tea custard we were served at the end was delicious as well! 	Clean and comfortable place for a massage by senior experience masseur/masseuse. Overall happy with the experience in a dimly lit room with soft music in the background.  NOTE: If you are paying with credit card, please note that it will incur additional 3%. 	The price is not cheap, the environment is OK! The clothes are clean and smell free! Friendly service! Volunteered to tip! 	Amazing massage, Maew was very sweet and put me at ease making me very relaxed. The after-massage tea and new snack was a delicious Thai tea custard. I felt very relaxed, will come back again the next time I'm in Thailand. 	Enjoyed my massage with Polla. Her massage was very good and made me feel  relaxed. The strength was just right! Her attitude and service are exceptionally great as well. Will definitely come back for her massage again. There was a small little snack provided after the massage. 	Found this place accidentally while walking around Siam Square late at night. Had a good massage, friendly staff and good treatment. End up came here 2 nights in a row. Clean area & open till late night! 	3.5 stars. The massage was alright for me, but my companions loved it. I personally felt that the masseur focused too much on the calves during the foot massage. Do note that if you pay by card or QR code (e.g. alipay), there'll be an extra 3% charge. 	I opted for the foot + neck shoulder massage. Yok was so good at it then I fell asleep! Will totally request for him again when I come back. Highly recommend! 	A good and proper massage place that pays attention to peace, silence and appropriate strength throughout the whole experience. They are beautifully furnished, very clean and zen vibe.  There’s a foot washing service for everyone regardless of the massage you choose. And their staff are really gentle and professional, they literally work and talk less.  The rooms and environment is very clean and you can see the whole place being very well-maintained. And they make sure everything is done properly, even down to placing a flower petal next to a cup of tea they serve you at the end of the service.  A place in central bangkok with good massage standards and better pricing amongst its competitors. Even the toilets are clean and odour free. 	I wanted to visit the nearby Let’s Relax but it was fully booked and didn’t have capacity for any walk-ins. Thankful to have found this place just nearby. They had immediate availability.  I opted for the 2h traditional Thai massage (THB 900) in a private room (THB 120/hr). The masseuse started off by washing my feet with soap and I was given a pair of slippers to wear inside. We then proceeded to the massage area. I enjoyed my massage, special thanks to Khun Daeng who was thoughtful and skilful. She accommodated to my requests and was patient and respectful. The room was also spacious and had relaxing spa music playing in the background.  After the massage I was served a cup of tea and small snack, which was a nice touch. The premises also has its own washrooms which are clean.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will recommend this place!  P.S. Cash and credit cards (+3%) are accepted here.
