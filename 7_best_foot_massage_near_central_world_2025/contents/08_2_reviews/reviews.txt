The <strong><u>Signature 5-in-1 massage</u></strong> was absolutely wonderful. Enjoyed every relaxing minute!
Two-hour <strong><u>herbal stone</u></strong> treatment was amazing. Staff extremely friendly and attentive.
<strong><u>Miss Ta</u></strong> literally healed my aching back. Best Thai massage in Bangkok!
90-minute foot massage helped me recover after a long shopping day.
The shop is beautiful and clean. <strong><u>Price is reasonable</u></strong> for this location.
<strong><u>Extra therapy techniques</u></strong> make this place worth the slightly higher price.
I fell asleep during the massage. The <strong><u>atmosphere</u></strong> is incredibly relaxing.
<strong><u>Best massage</u></strong> of my trip! Will definitely return on my next visit.
First floor room lacks privacy and you can hear noise from reception.
The massage was decent but the body oil felt excessively greasy.
