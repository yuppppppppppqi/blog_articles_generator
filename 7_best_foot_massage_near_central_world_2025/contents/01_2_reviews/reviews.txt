Perfect ending to a long shopping day. <strong><u>Therapist's skill</u></strong> made my tired feet feel brand new!
The <strong><u>complimentary stretching</u></strong> after my foot massage was a wonderful surprise.
<strong><u>Khun Mas</u></strong> gave an amazing signature massage and the mango sticky rice afterwards was delicious.
Fell asleep during my massage - best way to end my Bangkok trip!
<strong><u>Spotlessly clean</u></strong> facility with a serene atmosphere that instantly melts away stress.
The therapist knew exactly how to work out tension in my shoulders.
<strong><u>Kulamad</u></strong> used perfect pressure during my foot massage. Highly recommend!
Tried the <strong><u>Gua Sha treatment</u></strong> - my face felt incredibly refreshed afterward.
Massage was okay but the reclining couch was uncomfortable for Thai massage.
No clothes provided to change into and the masseur seemed a bit rushed.
