The pressure is right and comfortable and my masseuse was very attentive. When my toes cramped during the massage, she immediately applied a hot towel to my foot and massaged it to relieve the tension. My friends also praised the experience, saying it was very relaxing. 	We live in India and travel a lot to the far east My wife and I love massages The last time we were in Thailand for 15 nights We made it a point to try a different massage parlour each time But on this trip to Thailand , we discovered this massage parlour I got a massage at the hands of  Dountdee. I found her to be very effective She had good technique and was willing to give me a different intensity of foot massage Some customers like a light massage, whereas others may prefer a medium or high intensity massage Doundtee did a great job On my last three days in Bangkok, I came here thrice I have made up my mind every time I come here I’m going to come to the same parlour and if Doundtee Is available I will always use her services The rates are the same as everywhere else So why not come to a place where the masseur He is willing to make an extra effort  Great experience. Dountdee very very good  Lek strong lady. Strong hands	Was a bit cautious of all the 5-star ratings from many people with few other Google reviews, but this place was great. It’s in a row with 4-5 other massage places, each trying to sell their services as you walk by. Arun Piti seemed to have a better ambiance, and inside was calm, relaxing music, and a small fountain splashing gently. I got a foot and lower leg massage from Wan, while my wife got a full-body Thai massage. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed it. Perfect pressure, finding knots we didn’t know we had. Other guests also seemed very happy with the service based on their “OMG that feels good”-groans and expressions. Prices are also very good for the service. If we’re in MBK area again, we’ll be back! 	My wife and I went there at 9:30pm not knowing that the place closes at 10pm. However, the masseurs obliging completed their service without any short cuts or rushing us and they paid attention to detail to unravel the knots in my wife's legs. Got to speak to the husband of the owner and he was hospitable and friendly. I will recommend to anyone who wants a reasonable priced massage with good service! 	I had a wonderful foot massage by a young man. It was one of the best I had in Thailand after visiting and staying in more than 10 places all over the country. The less one star is because I had a bad headache a few hours later, which might(!) have happened because of his touching at the back of my neck. Either than that, as you can see, the place was packed and full. And yet, super quiet. Khob Khun Kha. 🙏😊 	Great relaxation in the MBK center. The staff is professional and helpful. Massage prices are affordable. The Arun Piti space is located on the fifth floor near the central escalator.	Absolutely amazing experience at Arun Piti Thai Massage! The ambiance is relaxing, the staff is professional, and the service is top-notch. A special shoutout to Khun Cake—truly incredible and extremely experienced. Their technique is exceptional, and they know exactly how to release tension and relieve stress. I left feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a high-quality massage in Bangkok! 	Tried this 5 star massage at MBK center.  Ms Apple assisted me and IT WAS THE BEST massage i had in my life.  I swear this shop knows what a "massage" is. Get the neck, shoulder, back with oil for very tired and aching back and shoulders.  Worth every penny.  Don't forget. Look for Ms Apple 	Amazing. I have had about 8 massages here and every one amazing. The staff are wonderfully caring and extremely skilful and always seem to be happy in their workplace. The shop is spotless and smells amazing. I wish I could take you all home with me! Cannot recommend this place enough for all Thai massage. 	Amazing massage! Best Thai massage I’ve ever had. The therapists are highly skilled :) I left feeling completely refreshed. Highly recommend! 	Visiting Thailand for the second time, had Thai Massage in many places but here was the BEST one. The masseuse ZeZa surprised me and made my body happy and stretched! Also what is important is that  they speak English, even though it’s basic they understand you what makes it easy to communicate. The owner was there as well and we had a nice talk! Will definitely come again! 	Ignore the other massage shops on the way. This is the best with good price value. The male masseuse was super friendly and always smiling. Tipping them is a pleasure 	We were received at once,all 8 of us and got wonderful and relaxing foot massage. The light was dimmed,place was tranquil so I really enjoyed this time. In another places is normally very noisy and therapists like to chat with each other. I love Arun piti place and I sincerely recommend it! 	I highly recommend this massage shop! Every therapist is skilled, but I particularly want to highlight Mr. Phet, whose expertise is exceptional. If you're seeking a quality massage, this is definitely the place to visit. 	I visited 6 times during my 2 week trip to Bangkok and was completely satisfied every time. Compared to other massage shops located in the same building, Arun Piti's prices are very reasonable and the quality is never lacking, so I had no reason to look for other shops. The foot massage is highly recommended, and the 30-minute head massage is more than perfect! The therapists are friendly and considerate, and the shop atmosphere is calm. Once you visit, you'll immediately understand why their Google rating is so high. Additionally my young daughter loved massages here as they are great with children. I recommend Arun Piti to anyone traveling to Bangkok and I will come back again on my next visit to Bangkok :) 	First time here for massage and I totally enjoy it! You must look for Meaw who is a very experienced masseur. Must come for massage if you are staying in Siam area 	It was an amazing experience. The atmosphere was relaxing, and the staff was professional and welcoming. The massage was tailored to my needs, helped relieve tension and stress. I highly recommend their services to anyone looking for a high-quality massage!
