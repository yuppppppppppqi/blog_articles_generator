My masseuse was <strong><u>very attentive</u></strong>. She immediately applied hot towel when my toes cramped.
<strong><u>Dountdee</u></strong> gave the perfect intensity of foot massage. I returned three days in a row!
<strong><u>Wan</u></strong> found knots I didn't know I had. The pressure was absolutely perfect.
The masseurs paid <strong><u>careful attention</u></strong> to unravel the knots in my legs. No shortcuts!
<strong><u>Khun Cake's technique</u></strong> is exceptional. Left feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated.
<strong><u>Ms Apple</u></strong> gave me the best massage of my life. Worth every penny!
The shop is spotless and <strong><u>staff are wonderfully caring</u></strong>. Every massage was amazing!
<strong><u>Masseuse ZeZa</u></strong> made my body happy and stretched. Their English made communication easy.
Had a slight headache hours after my foot massage. Might be from neck pressure.
The place gets very full, though they manage to keep it quiet.
