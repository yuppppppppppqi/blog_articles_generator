My <strong><u>two-hour massage</u></strong> was rejuvenating. The therapists have perfect technique and pressure!
<strong><u>Professional</u></strong> and friendly staff. The private room was spacious, clean and comfortable.
Booked the 5-in-1 massage. The masseuse was <strong><u>strong</u></strong> and everything smelled amazing.
The <strong><u>ambiance</u></strong> is incredibly calming with soft lighting and soothing music.
<strong><u>Four Hands facial</u></strong> treatment hit the spot after a long day of walking.
The neck and back massage was one of the <strong><u>best</u></strong> I've ever experienced!

<strong><u>Tea and cookies</u></strong> after the massage was a lovely finishing touch.
My masseur wasn't very skillful and missed some trigger points.
The music had an annoying high pitch sound from the aux cable.
