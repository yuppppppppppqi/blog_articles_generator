My masseuse was both firm and gentle, striking the perfect balance. My foot massage even came with a complimentary back and shoulder massage, which was a lovely surprise. Wrapped it all up with a soothing cup of tea‚Äîsuch a great experience! 	Love this place and we always come back here when we are in BKK. Currently there is a welcome coconut drink if you visit between 11am-5pm. The massage here is comfortable and the environment is feels great. 	Was a very pleasant experience! Obviously not the cheapest place you can go, but being a block away from where I‚Äôm staying at the Moxy and how great the staff is, I would come back again.  Included with the price with came a welcome coconut to drink out of (coconut only from 11am-5pm), and a tea and biscuit afterwards.	Had the most incredible Thai oil massage by V. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of massages over the years but this was by far the most detail oriented, intuitive one ‚Äî V got so many cracks out of my back and neck! I feel like i have a brand new spine! 	Amazing experience I got today. I am glad I gave up my thought to go for any other massage parlour and came here for the Office Syndrome Massage. It was a breathtaking experience. The masseuse was too good. I could never imagine they can be so professional! God bless her! May this place keep growing and providing it's services as today. Cannot express more in words. They're too good. 	The store delivered value at the cost of privacy & space. No online reservation. Payment was required upon the f2f booking. My massage therapist was not bad, but was simply pressing me at times (1hr full body). Give it a try, maybe it‚Äôd work for you. 	One of the best Thai Massage in BKK!  So relaxing and the service was amazing I Highly recommended 	Pok was amazing. The foot massage was so relaxing that I slept during the procedure. Good pressure and knowledge of all pressure points was the key‚Ä¶highly recommend. 	That'a my first time doing massage at Bangkok, and i'm fall in love at the first Try üòç the therapist is very good, i'm handle by therepist name Sood-Jai n my mom be mrs Yoya, mr. Sood - jai is an expert the massage is hard because my muscle very stiff but i dont feel pain at all , its really a nice experience to massage at City Of Massage because the massage really good, u must try it because after u massage here all ur fatigue from shoping will be disaapear like magic üòÅ 	Fantastic experience. Good price, clean and bright environment, staffs are courteous and polite. Massage skills also very good. Def will come back again! 	I had a fantastic one-hour foot massage with V, and I couldn't be more satisfied! From the moment the session began, V displayed great professionalism and skill, applying just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension while ensuring a deeply relaxing experience.  The massage was both therapeutic and rejuvenating‚ÄîV clearly understands how to target pressure points effectively. I left feeling completely refreshed, with lighter, more relaxed feet. The ambiance was also calming, adding to the overall enjoyment of the session.  If you're looking for a skilled and attentive therapist, I highly recommend booking a session with V. I'll definitely be back for another session soon! 	Came across this place by chance and the overall experience for me was a pleasant one. I was a bit doubtful at first as the ‚Äúroom‚Äù they brought me to for 60 mins Thai massage was covered by curtains only, but I truly enjoyed the massage (I heard the receptionist pronouncing the masseur‚Äôs name as Nhong & wrote her name in Thai for me). I love how she spent time to massage areas like shoulders & back - where I usually have stiff muscle due to bad posture and her strength is on-point.  Will definitely return the next time I visit Bangkok. 	Pok pok's service is very good, his approach is friendly and kind. Try it once you will get satisfied. 	My son and I went for foot massage and it was really good. Specially the one who massage me. I asked for strong massage and he really did good. Will come back again soon . My massage guy name V thank you V 	I have been here a few times for the past two visits to Bangkok. They are professional and friendly.  Today, I had V (masseuse name), and he did a pretty good job massaging my feet. He is crafty with his skills and would check on me if I am enjoying the session or not.	Low key think this place is a scam. Place is not relaxing one bit, massuese feels overworked, mine had barely energy left in her, I had to ask her to take it up several notches. I said I wanted to change my massuese and she did not allow me to. Pricey for what it‚Äôs worth. I would look elsewhere, bigger chains such as Lek.  Avoid the seat at the end. Worst seat ever. Not a comfortable experience and not the standard experience. Please do not get fooled.  Would not be back or will recommend to friends. 	Has to be one of the best places to get a foot massage in Bangkok! I went to a few other places but City of Massage was just something else. From the atmosphere to the masseuse. V gave me an hour long foot massage that left me rejuvenated for the rest of my trip. If you‚Äôre visiting Bangkok and looking for a foot massage, look no further!
