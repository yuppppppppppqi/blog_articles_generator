The <strong><u>deep tissue massage</u></strong> was perfect. Just the right pressure and herbal scent!
<strong><u>Thai massage</u></strong> with lots of pressure was exactly what I needed after traveling.
Their <strong><u>Rose and Champagne couple spa</u></strong> included everything. They even remembered my birthday!
<strong><u>120-minute hot oil massage</u></strong> was a dream. Left feeling completely refreshed.
<strong><u>Aromatherapy</u></strong> with rose oil was perfect for unwinding after a busy day.
The <strong><u>3-hour couples massage</u></strong> was out of this world. Gold facial was wonderful!
<strong><u>Staff</u></strong> asked about my preferences and focused on exactly where I needed attention.
<strong><u>Value for money</u></strong> is incredible - 5-star resort experience at a reduced price.
The service didn't start on time, though the massage itself was good.
They charge a 3% fee for Amex, which wasn't mentioned until payment time.
