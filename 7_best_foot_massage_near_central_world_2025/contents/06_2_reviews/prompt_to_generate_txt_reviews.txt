The deep tissue massage is exactly what my mom and I need!  It resonates through our whole body! The pressure is just right, the herbal is nice! I really love the ambiance and the staffs, so friendly!!!  One of the best massage I‚Äôve got so far (believe me, I am a big fan of massage!) 	I‚Äôve been traveling from Japan, Korea, and now to Thailand. My feet hurt, my back hurts & was in desperate need of a massage. I love a lot of pressure and boy did they deliver. I went with a Thai massage no oil for 60 mins. By far on the top best 3 massages I‚Äôve had. Experienced in pressure points. Planning to come back!  They took me as a walk in and I was grateful. You should try to make an appointment if you know your schedule. Easy to find, go up the elevator to the spa floor level 6.  They take Amex credit card yay! There is a 3% fee but no biggie Pricing all available before deciding  The staff speaks English well No trouble communicating  Pricing is so good and reasonable  Highly recommend 	Everyone was really kind and patient to explain in detail. the masseurs were professional and constantly ensuring that we were at top relaxing condition. Definitely worth every penny n time. Will be back when i visit bangkok again. 	Good experience. Staff are very friendly. choose for the 4hr Rose and Champagne couple spa. Package started with scrub , follow by aromatherapy massage then facial and bath. Will back again when visit to Bangkok 	I had the 120min hot oil massage and it was amazing. The service was from the start perfect and the massage was a dream I feel so relaxed and refreshed ‚ò∫Ô∏è After the massage you can shower and you get served a cookie and an a tee. A great experience üëåüèº ‚Ä¶ 	Nice ambience, clean environment. Staff are very friendly and smiley. Went for the 4h Rose and Champagne couple spa. Started with scrub then aromatherapy massage followed by facial then bath. Gifted me with a gift bag and birthday cake, knowing it‚Äôs my birthday today. Appreciative of their special arrangements. Will be back! 	This spa was recommended by the hotel we are staying at.  Staff speaks good English, I booked two services -- 2hrs aroma oil massage plus a 90-minute spa hair treatment.  The service did not start on time, but I wasn't in a hurry  The staff is excellent in her skill, very friendly, and kept checking on me if the pressure was right and if everything was to my liking.  The head spa was extremely relaxing  The whole place is clean and easy to locate -- take the first elevator from the entrance facing Siam Paragon, go up to the 6th floor, and the spa is right there. They run many specials, so be sure to check out their website! 	Had a wonderful aromatherapy massage at Treasure Spa. The space is calming, beautifully designed, and the staff were friendly and professional. My therapist was excellent ‚Äî the pressure was perfect, and the rose oil added a lovely touch. It was the perfect way to unwind after a day in Bangkok. Great value for the quality. Highly recommend! 	1950Baht for 90mins of treatment- inclusive of hair spa, neck and arm massages.. they also gave each of us a bottle of Nap Therapy mist!! üëçüèæ  Value for money and enjoyed the treatment throughout‚Ä¶ my therapist was gentle and careful throughout the process and I felt very comfortable and relaxed.  Recommended to try üëçüèæ 	Unbelievable experience.  Extra clean facility and ultra professional staff.  5 star resort spa experience but at much reduced price.  Shall come back often 	My husband and I visited Treasure Spa during our 15 year anniversary vacation to Bangkok. 10/10 recommended the 3 hour special, couples massage. It was out of this world! The gold facial was especially wonderful!! 	5 Stars - Highly Recommended!  I had an amazing experience at TREASURE Spa & Massage @BTS Siam. The staff were incredibly friendly, professional, and discreet, making me feel completely at ease from the moment I walked in. They were also very accommodating to my preferences, which I really appreciated. On top of that, their massage technique was top-notch‚Äîeasily one of the best I‚Äôve had in Bangkok. If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing, high-quality spa experience right in the heart of the city, this is the place to go! 	Absolutely beautiful experience! The Thai massage was top-notch‚Äîdeeply relaxing and expertly done. The place itself is nice, clean, and has a serene atmosphere that makes you feel at peace the moment you walk in. The masseuses are highly skilled professionals who know exactly how to melt away tension. Without a doubt, we‚Äôll be coming back for more! 	Excellent massage service in a calm & elegant place. Cooperative staff and my experience is so amazing! My husband and I have booked a couple massage in the same room. Both the relaxation and Thai massages were satisfying. And the staff served us a relaxing hot drink after finishing the massage. Thank You for making my holiday at Thailand so special. :) 	This is a very nice place and I enjoyed the massage here very much. Thank you for relieving me and the special photo gift! 	Calming environment on the 6th floor of Siam Square One. Before starting you are asked which areas you'd like to focus on as well as the intensity of massage you'd like. My masseuse had powerful hands throughout my two hour massage, very impressive. 	1The atmosphere at this spa is incredibly relaxing, and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure a perfect experience. I‚Äôve never felt more rejuvenated! The treatments were top-notch, and the attention to detail was exceptional.
