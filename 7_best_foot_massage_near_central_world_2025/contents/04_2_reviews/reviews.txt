<strong><u>Massage staff Ya</u></strong> was magnificent. My legs recovered completely from soreness!
The <strong><u>Thai Traditional massage</u></strong> was wonderfully relaxing in a clean, quiet setting.
The masseur worked out all my shoulder knots. <strong><u>Environment</u></strong> was zen and amazing!
<strong><u>Expert therapists</u></strong> and modern facilities made my pampering session truly enjoyable.
The lady massaged with <strong><u>perfect strength</u></strong> and served tea afterward. So accommodating!
After 20 days of travel, this <strong><u>best massage</u></strong> made me feel good as new!
The <strong><u>Pela Signature Relax package</u></strong> was excellent. Masseuse immediately found my problem areas.
<strong><u>Aromatherapy oil massage</u></strong> with herbal compress was super nice and worth every baht!
Massage was good but too light despite asking for more strength.
First floor area felt a bit cramped, though the massage itself was soothing.
