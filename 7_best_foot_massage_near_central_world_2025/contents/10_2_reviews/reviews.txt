The <strong><u>therapist</u></strong> was amazing! I fell asleep during my Thai massage with balm.
Masseuse <strong><u>Aoi</u></strong> worked wonders on my tight muscles. <strong><u>Best value</u></strong> in the area!
The foot massage was exactly what I needed after walking all day.
<strong><u>Service</u></strong> here is consistently great. I keep coming back whenever I'm in Bangkok.
The herbal padding massage was hot at times but ultimately very <strong><u>relaxing</u></strong>.
Chairs are comfortable and the <strong><u>ambience</u></strong> is perfect with calming music.
My masseur found every knot and worked them out. <strong><u>Feel like new</u></strong>!
Had a wonderful oil massage by <strong><u>Loma</u></strong>. Definitely coming back soon.
The massage was okay but I wish they'd focus more on pressure points.
Had to wait 10 minutes and the place is on the 3rd floor, a bit inconvenient.
