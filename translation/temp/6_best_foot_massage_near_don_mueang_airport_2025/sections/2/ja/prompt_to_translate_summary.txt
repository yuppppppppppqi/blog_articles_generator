I was given a private room with shower and the experience was perfect. Room was clean, therapist was experienced and price was reasonable. Will definitely come again. 	Feeling fresh and relax  like I’m in Japan. Nice and clean. Friendly staff. Reasonable price.  There are 3 types of Onsen experience., to day ai selected Noboribetsu Karurusu (Hokkaido) 	We booked both Onsen and Aroma massage package. They welcomed us with cups of tea and let us choose the Aroma scent and the colors of Onsen water.  The staffs here are friendly and helpful. I would definitely come again. 	Not sure how they have received such good reviews. My wife who is Thai and a massage therapist in Australia for the last 13 years in her own business just had a foot massage. As you can imagine I have had plenty of massages and my wife knows what she is doing. My massage was ok but my wife’s was awful and she Will praise if it deserves it. The massage felt like we were sitting on the main road which the shop is right next too. As a builder there would be ways to minimise the amount of noise but certainly not something they have worried about. Staff were reasonably friendly but I think pretty tired. Place was clean and welcoming towels and drink was nice. Overall for the money very disappointing. We would have come back tomorrow for additional massage of some type but will give it a big miss and try somewhere else. 	This shop is all you need for relaxation. It offers both massage and onsen in a very nice environment. Very good service and reasonable price ✅✅✅ 	The place is very peaceful and comfortable, suitable for the messy day. Should reserve for the onsen before coming. 	Best private Onsen so far in Bangkok with reasonable price and cozy vibe 🥰 … 	Nice service, Nice environment. Should go try once!! 	Very relax and reasonable price 	This place is amazing and comfortable for everyone. If you like easygoing,you could try to go here. 	Very nice relaxing environment. 	It's the best place. They have the best service. Super clean, friendly staff. Super helpful. Mind and body relax very well. 	Great experience very beautiful and great massage 	A cool place to get relaxed physically and mentally.The staffs are nice,well-trained and the service is satisfying enough.There is also a little cafe shop in front,the drinks are must-try!! Highly recommend for those who want a chilling day at Massage shop. 	While waiting for my queue at immigration, I had the idea to come get a foot massage and spend some time at a local Onsen! It was absolutely bliss! 🤩 … 	If you're looking for decent, clean, relaxing, and reasonable price massage, this place is highly recommended.  The staff can speak English, and the masseuses are experts . They also have complimentary tea that you can enjoy after the massage. 	It is absolutely a place to go. Perfect vibe and environment. Transports you to a relaxing zone immediately entering the premise.  The session for me is perfect with a lot of care and attentiveness. Is perfect for travellers entering Bangkok through Don Mueng Airport.  Catch a massage immediately arriving Bangkok gets u ready for the city and end the trip with a relaxing massage and revive you after the trip. Bring back the love and care from bangkok to your home.  Perfect
