I really like the menu. There are many new things. And what I like most is the standard. No matter who you massage with, it's the same. Mildly fragrant massage oil The scent is aromatic. There are 3 scents to choose from. I like every scent. It's real Essential Oil. After massaging, I feel light. I feel comfortable doing facials. My skin is so clear that my friends ask me what I did. Most importantly, the skin is strong and doesn't burn as easily as before. I give it 5 stars. 	Have been a regular customer here for many years. All the masseuses are good. The shop is beautiful and clean. The music plays very well. I really like the herbal compress massage. Fresh herbal aromatic compress After the massage I felt very relaxed.

Whenever I get tired, I think of Belessa, but you have to call and make a reservation in advance because there are a lot of customers here. I normally come here for a massage and like to scrub my skin and get oil massages. The staff here give very good massages, the atmosphere is good, the place is clean, there are a lot of treatments to choose from. 	Today I came to get a facial. This facial massage place is very good, both using hands and machines, depending on what you like. But personally, I prefer massaging my face with my hands. It's very comfortable. This place emphasizes on nourishment.
