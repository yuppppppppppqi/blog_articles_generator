The spa is good, smells great. Today I did a bridal course. It was very good. The skin is very soft and smooth. I'll come use the service again. 	Be a regular customer here Massage since the shop opened I didn't go anywhere for a massage. It's next to the shop, next to the doctor, everyone is really good at masseuse. There's a place to wait and there's a cute photo corner. I really like it. 10/10 	The dung bomb here is the best. Very satisfying scrubbing, clear skin. The shop is cute, minimalist, the atmosphere is really good. The masseuses take very good care of you. 	Very good massage. Today I come to massage my neck and shoulders. The shop is so relaxing. There's also relaxing music close to home, so you can scrub your body. Aromatherapy massage 	Search for a massage shop that you like. I really enjoyed this shop. The massage was good and on point. The shop and the staff provided good service. The massage was very good. The shop was very clean. I feel really relaxed. Entering the minimalist shop Very cute and pleasing. Come use the service often ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 	- The atmosphere in the store is good, clean, minimalist decoration. - Met a massage therapist who didn't complete the massage in full time. Started 15 minutes late but finished on time, not counting the actual start time. - Choose a Thai massage but it's more like a leg massage. During the head massage, stop massaging about 3 times, just touching the head.  Who is going to try it? But personally, it's a shop where I've gotten massages and I'm not impressed at all. 2 hours 600 baht. I still feel sorry for the money.	Today I came to get an Aroma massage for 2 hours. The shop's atmosphere is good, smells good, clean, there's plenty of parking. Dr. Na and the female doctor gave a very good massage. Will definitely come to use the service again. 	I drove down to Bangkok for several hours and was very tired so I looked for a massage shop. I found this shop. Good massage, very comfortable massage. After the massage there was no pain, very relaxing. 	I recommend it. The shop is clean, the staff provides good service, the price is not too high, and the massage is definitely good. 👍🏻👍🏻 … 	Spa shop near Sukhaphiban 5, beautiful shop with minimalist style. Good price, good massage skills.	Stop by for a spa massage after work. The shop is very cute. Enter and immediately feel relaxed. There are many programs to choose from. Affordable price  The staff provided good service, good massage, and I went home feeling comfortable. 	It's a good massage shop. The masseuse is very good, the hand weight is good, the acupressure is very good. (The masseuse's name is Noona). Good place, clean, good atmosphere. Will definitely come back for massage again. 	The shop is very good, clean, beautiful, has parking. Most importantly, the massage is very good. The masseuse's service is very good. I really like the aromatherapy massage. So satisfying. 	Massage shop, come try the scurf blasting course. The masseuse scrubbed every nook and cranny. The scum was spread out. The skin was clearer and the skin smoother. 	Come follow the review of the exfoliating bomb at Relax home Massage. I will say that it is very satisfying and comfortable. The shop's premium formula, especially the milk that smells so good. Ready to steam with herbs Followed by an explosion of dung. Finish with a Hokkaido milk cream mask. Cover with an infrared blanket and apply skin lotion. White skin really brightens. As they reviewed 🤍 	Today I went to use the massage service at the shop for the first time. I was impressed by the admin staff who accepted the massage reservations. They spoke very well. Clean massage place Japanese minimalist style The service used is neck and shoulder massage, priced at 350 baht per hour.  The younger sister massaged with the masseuse, named Khun Rin, who massaged very well, was very hospitable, and always asked if it hurt.  As for the other masseuse, named Khun Suay, who massaged like she was not willing to massage, she massaged very rough, focused on using her elbows, didn't ask the customer, didn't ask the customer if it hurt or not. Until I massaged until there was still 5 minutes left before I asked. I'm going to massage my head but not wash my hands. After touching the body massage oil Then come and rub the head of the customer. This is the first time I've encountered something like this. I'm very shocked.  Overall, I recommend this shop. But you may have to choose a masseuse. I'd like to introduce you to Rin.
