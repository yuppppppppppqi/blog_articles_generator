Nut was incredibly professional and knew exactly how to work out the tension in my shoulders and neck. The pressure was perfect, and I left feeling so much lighter and more relaxed. You can tell she really understands the body and takes her time to focus on problem areas. Highly recommend her if you’re dealing with stress or sitting at a desk all day. Five stars all the way!	I had an amazing massage! The masseuse was able to use very firm pressure which I have not had in long time. They were very throughout and all my sore spots were seen to. The tea before and after was amazing. The spa is super nice, very clean and welcoming. They speak pretty good English too. Highly recommend. 	This is a hidden gem in Bangkok, highly recommend for everyone who visited Bangkok. We booked for 2hr of body scrub and aroma oil massage. The therapist has very good technique which addressed our pain points during the massage. The ambience of this spa is very cozy, almost fell asleep during the massage. Love it! 	It was great experience overall. Very clean and very kind. But i think body scrub needs to be changed. It doesn’t melt at all, for an hour therapist just really hardly scrub my body and it turns out super red and hurts. My skin is not really sensitive skin but since people came here for a vacation, it could be too rough for the skin. Massage was great! 	I had a wonderful experience! This place is a must try! The place has such a wonderful atmosphere and everyone is so polite.  I chose the herbal ground signature massage and the facial lifting and head massage.  The herbal ground signature massage was such a unique experience and one of the best ones I’ve had so far. Close attention to details of the body and perfect pressure  The facial lifting and head massage left me with a baby skin, truly a must! 	I recently indulged in a hot coconut oil head massage, and it was nothing short of blissful. The warm oil, infused with its natural soothing aroma, was gently massaged into my scalp with expert hands, creating a deeply relaxing and rejuvenating experience. The therapist’s technique was perfect, with just the right pressure to release tension while promoting circulation. Overall, really great, highly recommended. 	I did Herbal Ground Refresh and it was amazing! Very relaxing and satisfying experience at a reasonable price :)  Staffs are very friendly and relaxing & cute vibe as well! They also serve tea before and after the massage.  Thank you for the wonderful experience! Will 100% come back again. 	A true oasis of serenity in the middle of the city! Had a fantastic massage , the place is clean and all staff extremely professional. I couldn’t recommend it enough for a moment of self-care.  I got a 60 minute aromatherapy massage, it was relaxing and released lots of tension in my back. 	I got a great organic facial here. It was truly wonderful and relaxing. You can tell the products are really fresh and good for your skin. The head massage was included and so relaxing. It’s a great price for quality experience. It’s a little tricky to find but my grab driver was able to find it. Highly recommend. 	Very nice atmosphere, staff friendly and was talking English. The service is amazing and I really enjoyed the tea, especially dragon blood one. They also have some items available for sale. Environment is very clean, which is great and puts the place on the higher level. I will be coming back for sure. Come for a good massage when you are in the area! :) 	A nice experience with a check in at reception to decide which part I wanted the masseuse to focus on and what aromatherapy oil ! I had the 2 hours package with an hour body scrub and an hour massage ! The place was clean and massage was good ! 	Great self care afternoon! 💆🏻‍♂️ 💆🏻‍♀️  Served by Mameow and Miow, I took the hair massage while my wife took the 30 minutes longer variant which includes a foot and shoulder massage.  The service was attentive and masseurs were professional. The ambience was cosy too, with tea served before and after the massage.  Great hidden spot to spend our afternoon, well worth the money and time spent 👍🏻 	Relax atmosphere. Professional staff. I had deep aroma Thai massage for 2 hours. Amazing service. My muscles are less intense. Will definitely come back. 	All ingredients used were perfect. Very calm and good atmosphere. They don't have private room !, Rest all is great, masseuse was wonderful at her job. Feeling refreshed after a long long time. 	I recently visited HERBAL GROUND for a Thai massage, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was calming and welcoming. The staff were professional, and the massage itself was incredibly soothing, combining traditional Thai techniques with a focus on relaxation and muscle relief. I felt completely rejuvenated afterward!  A huge thank you to the talented therapists for their skillful hands and attention to detail. Your dedication and expertise made this visit unforgettable. I'll definitely be returning and recommending this wonderful place to others! 	If you are in the area this spa is a MUST, they are cozy and amazingly comfortable. They have their own locally made products that smell and feel heavenly. I did the 4 hour deep sleep full message, facial and other perks!! You won’t leave unhappy. 	Chanced upon Herbal ground while looking for facial options and decided to walk in after seeing the reviews. Really comfortably and clean place, and thoroughly enjoyed the facial! It was simple, natural (not the type with machines - but they do explain what it includes) and I really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back!
