Cute foot spa amongst many in this area. Just a short walk up Soi 24 from Phrom Phong BTS station. Also right across from EMporium Shopping Mall.  This small shop has a beach like vibe. It was clean and the staff were well trained and professional.  I book through GoWabi APP. No pressure but if use my discount code 'travis-1716046' you save ฿100 off your first booking! 	This is amazing place for massage, feel so cozy, clean, good service staff always smile very professional,  highly recommended 🫶🏾🫶🏾 … 	Amazing service. The facility is clean, modern and well-decorated. Pricing is about 300-400 bhat for Thai massage 60 mins. They give you discount if come before 5p.m (so called happy hours). Staff polite and have good techniques. Thumbs up! 	Unfortunately I had an unpleasant experience.  It’s open walls so the guy next to me was snoring and moaning really loud to the point he started snorting.  The staff is nice but the massage itself is pretty average.  I paid for their best recommended (2hrs body relaxation).  I think they’re normal foot/leg massage looks decent but wouldn’t recommend a full body massage. 	Randomly went into this massage parlour at 9:30pm and it was the best decision ever. They only take cash but anyways I chose the Deep Tissue Thai Massage with Thai Balm and i was surprisingly impressed the lady masseuse was strong & hit all the right aching spots. I have been to a few other massage places around Bangkok and they were all high end and all disappointing, so glad to suddenly chance upon this massage place which wasn’t expensive and gave me the best massage ever ❤️  Look for a girl named “Tae” , she massaged me so well eventho I didn’t direct her to my aching spots. Blessed to have gotten her on my last night in Bangkok ❤️ she deserves all the tips 👏🏻 	Randomly chanced upon this massage store and decided to give it a try because it’s always crowded (this was before we saw the reviews). Turned out to be one of the best decision on our trip.  I did a 1 hour foot massage and my husband did a 1 hour 4-in-1 which is foot shoulder head and neck.  My masseur for foot was fantastic!! Right amount of strength which really helped to relieve the ache. Lots of focus on the sole of the foot which I enjoyed. They also apply oil for the massage which felt really good.  I like that the Chair could be inclined so very comfortable. They also offered me a change of pants because I was wearing a dress.  Even though the space is open it was quite quiet and relaxing.  Note that they only accept cash here and you get 100baht discount for selected massage if you visit before 3pm.  Highly recommend ! We might just be back again :) 	Chanced upon this massage shop in the Phrom Phong area. Since my feet was aching from all the walking, decided to go for an hour of foot massage. In that street along itself, I counted another few more massage shops nearby. The shop has a nice ambience, with soft music playing in the background. The receptionist was friendly and they many many massage package to suits everyone.  I opted for the 60mins foot massage which was 420baht, not the cheapest in Bangkok but still okay. Upon making my payment, i was then ushered to the back of the shop to have my feet clean. The massage felt good, my feet felt more relieved from the sore.  If you happen to be staying around that area, can consider giving their massage a try. 	The shop atmosphere is good. The masseuse massages gently and seems lazy. I told her to massage harder, but she nodded in acknowledgement, but the massage was the same. The price is expensive. I've been here twice and been disappointed twice. If I don't come again, it's not worth the money. 	Clean, nice and calm athmosphere. Good massage (4 in 1 therapy), the foot massage was with a perfect pressure. Before 5 pm happy hour with 100bht discount. 	I had a massage with Poy from the Thai Thai next to the JW Marriott Marquis and she was beyond FABULOUS !!!! Strongly recommend going and only asking for her - if you want to relax and get more value for your money 	Honestly upset with my experience here. We paid for a couples with the aroma with the hot compress. I didn't want super deep pressure, but not light either. First, nobody asked at all what we wanted, or about the pressure. Then, there was no aroma at all.. and usually you get to choose which kind of aromatherapy. There wasn't any the entire time. The hot compress was only used for about 5 minutes. And my entire 'massage' felt like a very fast and light lotion application. No massage. There therapists kept talking to each other and laughing. It felt uncomfortable. It's my birthday today, and this was a disappointing experience. It really feels like I wasted my time. 	Came here without fail every night of our trip. Definitely 5stars. Look for Mo or Rat. Extremely great massage service you will get from them! There are two thaithai massage on the same street! Go to this one! Both masseuse and price is better. 	Unfortunately my least favorite massage in Thailand so far. Aggressive, erratic, not very symmetrical. I’m sure there are some lovely therapists but unfortunately I got a bit unlucky. Left in a bad mood. 	The Thai massage was great. Feel very relaxed after.. and the atmosphere of the massage place is so clean and nice. 	I enjoyed my 90mins Thai massage here. It costs me only 500baht (after 10% discount) and the service was really good. Even without discount, the massage is 400baht per hour. It’s much cheaper than the massage within the central area. There are several floors in the place and you will be brought to upstairs for getting the thai massage. The air con here could be a bit cold, please make sure you let them know if any adjustment is needed. 	I left this place feeling very stressed.  First, the place is not very clean. There is only one toilet and it's old and dingy. Second, the massage was so bad I actually stopped in the middle and asked to speak to a manager. I get regular  massages and this was the first time in my life I've asked the masseuse to stop. It felt like a kid was just slapping their hand back and forth. She also kept getting the scrub cream in my hair until I asked for a hairnet or towel.  When I tried to speak to the manager to change the person, they said it was too late and that it had been over 10 minutes. I tried to explain that I did stop within 10 minutes and time was spent trying to explain to the masseuse and time for her to go get a manager. I ended up just cutting the massage short as I felt so uncomfortable there.  I had gotten a body scrub, and afterwards they give you a  towel and walk you down the hall to this dirty little shower to rinse off. I had to just walk in my towel back to the room to get dressed.  Afterwards, the front desk hardly seemed to care or offer any apologies. This was a horrible experience. 	To be fair, it’s one of the really clean places with very good massage but the 60 minutes turns out to be 45 minutes of actual massage, other than that I would have definetly given them 5 stars
