The therapist was really amazing.the massage was so good that I fell asleep and even snored! I really loved it and will definitely come back next time.” 	1 ⭐️ for lathering moisturiser on my leg sparingly otherwise nope none.  My Fiancé and I were 5 mins late for our slot and when we arrived and the manager treated us like we were some criminal “The 2 staff waiting for you. You 5 minutes late” and slams the clock towards us.  Said we needed to use the toilet and the staff did not provide any specific directions other than “there!” pointing to the door. Through the door, there were 3-4 massage cubicles? Felt like I was walking into Narnia.  Came out it was close to 5.10pm? And I guess they had to fast forward my 1 hour slot into 45 mins? The masseuse rinsed and washed my leg very unwillingly. During the massage, my Fiancé’s masseuse went in at a slow and relaxing pace while mine felt like she was rushing to make a million pastry dough.  Went out and realise everyone had their bags stored beside the counter while we were instructed to keep our bags with ourselves 🙂  So if you’re looking for a place to make your blood boil, do visit this massage place. Totally not worth the money.	More people need to know about this place! The TLDR — cheap and good!!!!  Masseuse Aoi was extremely skilled and I felt so relieved after the massage. We opted for 90mins traditional Thai massage and felt super relaxed throughout. Many options for massage in Thailand but this is one that didn’t disappoint, didn’t cost an arm and a leg and was 100% satisfying. Will be back for sure!  Update: Went back the second time and I’m glad to share that the quality remained the same!	Staff are honest.I remove my old eyelashes and the staff told mi my real eyelashes are weak even redo oso won't last long.. end up my girl do the manicure.. this is the nice hardwork from them.. will definitely come back next trip 	We had an incredible foot massage here, and it was exactly what we needed after a long day of walking. The experience was super relaxing from start to finish.  It begins with a careful and thorough cleaning of your feet, which immediately sets a soothing tone. Then, you’re guided to a dark and quiet room with soft, relaxing music playing in the background. The ambiance is perfect for unwinding, and the armchairs are so comfortable it’s almost impossible not to drift off to sleep.  The massage itself was excellent—just the right amount of pressure to relieve tension without being uncomfortable. It left us feeling refreshed and re-energized.  On top of that, the service was great, and the price was very reasonable for the quality offered.  This is definitely a must-visit spot if you’re looking to relax and pamper yourself. Highly recommended! 	It was really great and calm. I did fell asleep for a while. It wasn’t too cold nor hot. Everything was perfect. Fantastic massage. The tea after the massage was romantic and lovely. 	Have a family of 5 (2 elderly and 3 adults including me). Got unlucky to have customer that was snoring beside us. Thought the masseuse could have done better to make the place a more pleasant for other customers. Reason i give 1/5, only i feel that my masseuse was good. Being very honest here. Kinda unbelievable for the ratings that it was given. Very disappointed as i was the one that introduced this to my family. Will never come back again. Probably try other places. 	Came here first time for massage in Oct 2024 and recently again for a pedicure. Really love the service here with great and helpful staffs. Price is reasonable and their service is 💯 would recommend and will patronise whenever I travel to Bangkok❤️ 	I really like this Thai massage place. I saw it while having food & drinks at 🥦 Revolution across the street. It is very convenient to get to it after having some nutrients. It's so good because there are some organic stores on the ground floor, you climb the stairs to get your feet washed consciously and thoroughly. I tried the herbal padding massage today, and it was a bit hot at times but relaxing. You climb one more floor and you get to see an ice bath for soothing and relaxing the body; on the same floor you get to see a co-working station for digital nomads. If you're a smoker, you would have to go to the very top floor for that. 	Good massage, there was a little bit of a wait (10 minutes) and it's on the 3rd floor but they have free wifi. The foot, neck, shoulder, and head massage was super relaxing and the chairs are very comfortable. The ambience is nice and the music is very calming. 	Edit (June 2024): Changed my rating from a 3 star to a 4 star because I went for another round of body massage and foot massage. The masseur this time was skilled and massaged all the muscle knots out of my body.  Previous review: There were two ends to the spectrum regarding the rating for this place. One companion and I felt that this was very average and leaned more towards 2.5 stars, but my two other companions felt that this was fantastic and kept coming back. I went for a full body massage, foot massage and shoulder massage by two masseurs.  For the full body massage, I felt that the masseur didn't exert enough force in the right areas and somehow managed to miss all the sore spots. As for the foot massage, I suspect that the masseur was new, so she kept focusing on the calves; I had to tell her to stop doing that and to focus on the feet. Also, what she did for the right foot, she didn't do for the left foot, so it felt a little lopsided e.g. she would massage a certain pattern on the right foot but forgot about it when she did the left foot. She was great at shoulder massage though, which was a pleasant surprise.  This place is really popular with tourists and their business is good. Book in advance if you'd like to secure a slot. 	Amazing 5 star experience in the heart of Siam. Good pricing too - 500baht for 1.5 hours flew by just like that. Recommended! Will visit again! 	Found this massage place after the damage that C-19 has brought to the world… not many massage shops left at the siam area, the remaining ones can’t be bothered with you at all. I randomly walked into Napar Massage and got myself booked for a 60 min foot massage. tidy and clean environment (at least the waiting area)  I had a masseur who didn’t use much strength at first seems like she’s just applying massage oil on me.. so I told her to put in a bit more strength and she did, but I felt she did not use consistent strength throughout. 	Had one of the best massages here. The staff is very courteous and professional. You'll have so many options to choose from. Ideally should reserve as it tends to be booked out. Overall a very good experience. 	Sub-par oil massage at an average price. You’re paying more for the environment which is admittedly nicer than the average street shop . For oil massage 2 pax there is a couple room which a separating curtain if you like to use it. They provide disposable undies. 	I had a very bad experience at Napar Massage in Bangkok. During the session, the therapist kept massaging the same spot with excessive pressure, despite it feeling uncomfortable. I didn’t realize the extent of the damage until I returned to my hotel, only to find my skin bruised and injured (photo attached). A massage should be relaxing, not painful and harmful. The lack of proper technique and care from the staff is unacceptable. I do not recommend this place to anyone looking for a safe and professional massage experience. 	I had a whole body oil massage by Loma. It was amazing. I’d definitely come back and most definitely recommend it.
