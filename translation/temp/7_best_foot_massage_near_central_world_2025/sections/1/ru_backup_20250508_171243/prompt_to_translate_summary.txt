The foot massage was incredibly relaxing and soothing. The therapist was attentive and skilled, focusing on all the right pressure points. The atmosphere was calm and serene, with soft lighting and peaceful music, making it the perfect escape from daily stress. My feet felt revitalized and pampered, and I left feeling completely rejuvenated. Highly recommend this spa for anyone in need of a relaxing and therapeutic foot massage! 	Tried their healing foot massage for one hour and it's worth spending my time for! Their therapist really has a soft and light hand for the massage. I really felt so relaxed from beginning to end. After the foot massage, they will also briefly give you stretching and shoulder massage, which will complete the whole relaxing experience. For only 750 baht, this is really worth your money! I will definitely go back for their service again. 	Extraordinary massage ever!!  I recently visited KLINIQ Spa, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The moment I walked in, I was welcomed by a calming atmosphere with a clean and modern design that instantly made me feel relaxed.  The massage was absolutely outstanding—one of the best I’ve ever had! The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and focused on my specific needs. Every movement felt purposeful, leaving me completely rejuvenated by the end of the session.  The spa itself was spotless, with great attention to hygiene, which added to the overall sense of comfort. The serene ambiance, soothing music, and subtle aromatherapy scents created the perfect environment for relaxation.  If you’re looking for a spa that combines professionalism, cleanliness, and a truly relaxing experience, KLINIQ Spa is the place to go. I can’t wait to return! 	Highly recommended! This is the best spa in this area. I tried signature massage 1.5hr with khun Mas she is amazing! After the massage, they have complimentary mango sticky rice. Really delicious! 	Let’s relax then beyond relaxation !!! This place is provide an incredible amazingly massage experienced. Yes, besides the quality of product they use but the masseuses they actually professional and certified. I have received the oil massage from them first time, and I love it!!!!!!!!! This place deserves more than 5 stars from me !!!!! 	I had a great experience at this place！We found this spa after shopping in the siam square, quite and private. The staffs are super nice and well considered 👍🏻Definitely will come again! … 	This was an incredible massage! Every single muscle is feeling relaxed and rejuvenated! The last of my 9-day trip to Bangkok, and what a way to say good y to beautiful Thailand and its beautiful people! I was so tense from walking and sightseeing these past few days. I didn’t know how much I needed this. I feel brand new and ready to do it all over again! The facility was clean, high-end and very professional. It was so posh! I enjoyed a purple lemonade of some sort before my massage and I’m sad because I know I can only get it here! I had a mango and purple sticky rice upon completion of my massage, and it was so delicious and pretty! I promise to come back to Thailand and visit KLINIQ again. It was the highlight of my trip! 	I had a relaxing massage at Kliniq, gifted to me recently. The atmosphere was calm and inviting and the therapist was highly skilled and attentive. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I would highly recommend. 	Did Thai massage and facial KuaSa here! . The ambiance was soothing, making it the perfect place to unwind. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quality self-care experience! 	I recently visited a brand-new spa located in the heart of Bangkok, and I had the chance to try their gua sha body massage—and I can honestly say it was an unforgettable experience.  Gua sha, an ancient Chinese therapy, uses smooth stones or tools to scrape the skin gently, which stimulates circulation and helps to release built-up tension in the muscles. During my session, the therapist applied just the right amount of pressure, making sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment. The technique is excellent for relieving muscle soreness, improving blood flow, and even promoting lymphatic drainage. After the massage, I felt a noticeable sense of lightness and relaxation in my body, as if all the stress had melted away.  The spa itself was tranquil, with soothing music and a peaceful ambiance that added to the overall relaxation. The therapist was skilled and attentive, making sure to focus on my problem areas while maintaining a gentle and therapeutic approach.  If you’re looking to try something different or if you’re dealing with tension or muscle fatigue, I highly recommend this gua sha body massage. It’s a unique and effective way to relax and revitalize. I’ll definitely be returning to this spa for more treatments in the future! 	The first impression is nice. Staff at reception is polite and serve us welcome drinks upon arrival and I think the nice part will just end here. Took a 1 hr 30 mins package which include 1 hrs thai massage and 30 mins foot massage. It is my first time to experience Thai massage on a reclining couch used for foot massage which is totally uncomfortable.  No clothes were given to change and masseur were pretty restless. Will definitely go for other spa as there are many other options in Bangkok. 	Great spa experience in the heart of Siam Square. I try Gua Sha face massage today and it was really good treatment, my face feeling so fresh & clean after treatment. 	Luxurious feeling, clean and upscale spa. My husband got a foot massage here while I got my nails done across the hall at Morning Kiss. Great spa experience! 	I had the guasha treatment  The staff were amazingly hospitable, welcoming and professional. The therapy was super relaxing, the massage was great. Most surprising of all was the mango sticky rice they provided at the end that was super delectable.  Would highly recommend this. 	Amazing place with spacious, clean and well maintained rooms. Comes with the option to shower if you opt for their oil massage as well.  Was surprised that their bed has heating function which was amazing + the mango sticky rice dessert that was given after the massage. 10/10 would recommend if you’re nearby the area. 	I revisited Kliniq Wellness Spa at their Siam Square One branch on the 6th floor. The location is very convenient, as it’s near the BTS, making it easy to access. I had a 60 mins foot massage with the therapist, Kulamad, who provided a relaxing experience with the perfect amount of pressure to relieve stress and tension. I highly recommend Kliniq Wellness Spa for anyone looking for a convenient and professional spa experience. 	The therapist used smooth, flowing strokes with just the right amount of pressure. It was clear they were experienced and knew exactly how to work out the tension in my muscles, especially in my neck and shoulders.
