From the moment I walked in, I was met with a warm and calming atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. The staff is not only professional but truly caring, taking the time to understand my needs and tailor the massage accordingly.  The skill and expertise of the therapists are outstanding—they intuitively know how to release tension and restore balance, leaving me feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. Every detail, from the soothing ambiance to the attentive service, reflects their dedication to holistic healing.  If you’re looking for a place that goes beyond just a massage and truly cares about your well-being, Nature Thai Massage is the perfect choice. I’m already looking forward to my next visit! 	Went here for massage and received such a pleasant welcome. Very polite and professional. Always been here each time I come to Thailand. Massage was great and very nice. I am pleased! 	***Shop gives out free gifts for 5 stars reviews on tripadvisor***  I personally find it quite rare to pay first before the service. I asked for a male masseur but I ended up got a female one who was not entirely professional.  Throughout the massage, her strength was not consistent and sometimes I felt like she was just barely touching here and there. If I closed my eyes she would use even less strength. So I had to open my eyes and play with my phone the whole time so she would not dare to get too relaxed and lazy.  There are other cheaper options in the area to try out. 	We had a fantastic traditional Thai dry massage two years ago and the quality has remained great when we returned for a dry back and shoulders massage tonight. Recommend this place - clean, AC and therapists with a lot of strength. 	Since a tremendous experience that I came here almost everyday during my time in Bangkok and I can’t recommend it enough. The body massage with hot herbal press was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep immediately. The masseuse were always consistent each time I’m here. Definitely a must go the next time I’m here in Bangkok. Thank you! 	Explore a new massage place at Siam Square Soi 5 . Called Nature Thai Massage , not bad services. I took the 5 in 1 therapy! Feel relax and nice!must go visit next time! 	Went for the traditional Thai massage, they had an offer on so did the 90 minute one instead of 60 minutes. Accept cash and card - for card payment, will have 4% charge. It was really nice and peaceful, got given tea and biscuits afterwards as well. The staff members were lovely and polite, definitely recommend this place! 	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the 5 in 1 therapy massage at Nature Thai Massage.  From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. The atmosphere is calming, and the therapists truly know their craft. Each technique used was tailored to my needs, leaving me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.  A huge thank you to Nong and Nok for their exceptional services and professionalism.  If you’re looking for a great and relaxing massage, look no further! I highly recommend visiting Nature Thai Massage. You won't be disappointed! 	The best massage I’ve had in Bangkok so far! Staff are all lovely, especially Jum and Joy, who put in a lot of care and effort into their work. We will definitely be returning! :) 	The massage was relaxing and refreshing , the ladies who assisted us were kind and friendly. Their English was good which made it easier to communicate about what we prefer . 	One of the best massages i’ve ever had . Definitely worth visiting here again!!!! strongly recommend Jum, she has the strength and really help me relieve my muscle pains. Thank you very much! 	Nature Thai massage is truly amazing. If you are trying to heal, destress, or find relief, this is one of the best massage spots in Thailand. The staff are very skilled, attentive, and very kind. The price is excellent for the excellent quality massage. I highly recommend, 6/5 stars!! 	Love it ! Our return for the 5-1 massage at the same shop 🥰..  Visit shop before 5pm get 20% discount ! 😊 … 	Lovely massage in Bangkok. Staff are friendly and the massage is well priced. We have been back twice now! Recommend 😊 … 	Massage therapy was great and I enjoyed such a unique experience here at Nature Thai Massage. Aroma Stress Relief Massage was amazing! There was product that they use with you that you couldn’t find in any other massage place! : ) highly recommended 	Very relaxing massage done and the masseuse is very professional. Definitely recommend you to come here and try. 	Decided to get their deep sleep massage (Indian head massage + aromatic stress release). It was a mediocre body massage, felt like the masseuse was just going through the motions. The Indian head massage was rubbish; it is not even a real Indian head massage. I think they need to tell customers that your hair will be covered in tons of oil. I would have rather a normal head massage than this “Indian head massage” which is just hair pulling. The lady even told us we may not be able to pay by card as they might reach their limit for the day?? And so we should pay by cash… I said I had no cash and only card and the transaction went through
