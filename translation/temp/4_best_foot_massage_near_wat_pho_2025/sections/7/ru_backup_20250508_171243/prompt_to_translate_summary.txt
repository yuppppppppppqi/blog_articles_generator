Foot massage will be 200 bhat for one hour. It’s worth it to try if you come for shopping all day long. It helps you relieve the pain of your feet. 	Had an amazing experience here with my family. Total of 3 pax. The place is very clean and cozy. The staffs and the lady Boss are friendly. We had a 90mins body massage and it was very comfortable and professional.  We had an amazing time here. Highly recommended. 	I was quite exhausted and stressed today. My back felt heavy and painful. Thankfully, I decided to try a massage at this spa. And I was quite delighted with the service they provided. It is worth the money. Honestly, after the massage, I went from really stressed and fatigue to feeling completely  relaxed. I will definitely come back.	Initially, i had some doubts about the place because it was a little sketchy at the 2nd floor. Personally had the 1 hour thai massage and lo and behold, it was the best thai message ive ever had! For context i am from the Philippines and i always get thai massages from the Philippines. Anyway, the thai massage was too good. We went down the 1st floor and saw the line of people getting foot massages. Due to the immense joy we had, we also decided to get the 1 hr foot massage as well. It did not disappoint! Objectively speaking the massage is a 9/10, the attitude of my masseuse was 9/10, ambiance is a 7/10, and price is 8.5/10. Would definitely go here again when I go back to bangkok! 	Very nice experience, I had a foot and shoulder massage. Mod was very very good and professional.  I have received many Thai massages in my life as I have spend nearly a year here and it was one of the best! Recommend 100%!	5/5 stars! I highly recommend Pratunum Thai Massage for a consistently exceptional massage experience. My go-to masseuse is Rot - she's incredibly skilled, strong, and always targets my trouble spots. I've never been disappointed! If you're looking for a reliable and rejuvenating massage, look no further." 	I had a fantastic massage here and it was so affordable!  The staff were all super friendly and helpful too.  It was really relaxing and I felt so much better afterwards.  Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a great massage.  I'll definitely be back! 	Very disappointing experience. This was by far the worst massage I’ve ever had. The therapist clearly lacked both technique and experience. I booked a one-hour foot massage, but she repeated the same motion the entire time with no variation. Despite asking multiple times for more pressure, she barely adjusted and continued with a very lazy approach. It felt like she wasn’t even trying. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this place. 	Excellent service, good masseuse no hard selling. No need tippimg. The reviews speak for each self. A++++ 	We had amazing Thai massages after a long day of walking around Bangkok! They also gave me an outfit to change into to make sure I was comfortable (and covered) throughout the massage as well. Highly recommend! 	Authentic Thai massage with a very reasonable price. Masseuse was well trained and well spoken. She knows English. Very calm. She was excellent at the work. They will take once the massage finishes. Very dedicated staff. Loved the service very much 10/10 	It’s cheap but they don’t take the time they sell (had at least 10 min less) and they make it very quick. The girl that massaged me pinched my thighs at least 5 times cause she sat on them and was very, very hard and therefore hardly relaxing. Also she tried to convince me to take 1,5 hours instead of one hour while already massaging me (highly unprofessional cause I already decided). It's cheap but still not recommended. 	Best massage ever in the town!! Will come back tonight 	Taking oil relaxaxing massage, very worth the price for 400 thb for 1 hour. They have clean and private room. The massage is very good and strong, very relaxing 	I have been to different massage places for some foot massage, and this place is definitely the one I will come back to when in town. Very good massage. My feet feels so light afterwards. The place might not look as good in comparison to newer places, but the price and massage is definitely better (solely based on my experience). 	I just got a 1 hour full body Thai massage and it was such a good experience! I was just walking around and I stumbled upon this place, checked the prices and the reviews and I was convinced. The lady was hitting all the right spots and I told her where it was more painful and she “customized” the massage. Would totally recommend 😁 … 	Foot massage was not impressive, basically just rubbing oil on the shins, not much attention paid to the feet. Massage salon is quite dirty, furniture is worn out. I do not recommend wasting your time and money here 👎 … 	This place will be my go-to Thai massage. I got my foot massage here. They have good massage techniques and the atmosphere is nice. Compared to other stores that I went to, I'm very satisfied with this place.	Came here for the great reviews. And it was the closest massage shop at that point to me with a back pain and feet. We tried the coconut body massage however didn’t really suit us i guess.  It was too strong for me and my body still hurt after the session 😅 … 	We got the 1-hour foot and back massage. It was great. The pressure and technique was very good. They wash your feet first then give you tea at the end. For the combination massage, you are sitting for the back portion - not laying flat. We will definitely return when we’re in the area.
