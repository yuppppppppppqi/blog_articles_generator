The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing, with a soothing scent and soft music that set the perfect mood. The staff was warm and welcoming, making me feel comfortable from the moment I arrived.  I chose the aroma oil massage (lemongrass & eucalyptus), and it was absolutely wonderful. The therapist was highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure while using aromatic oils that helped me fully unwind. The combination of gentle strokes and deep relaxation techniques melted away all my stress and tension. After the session, I felt completely refreshed and rejuvenated.  Overall, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-quality Thai massage experience. I will definitely be coming back!	If I can give more than 5 stars I would! The customer service is exceptional! I was looking for a head spa massage to gift for my boyfriend. I reached out to them through Instagram and happy to get a fast and very accomodating response.  They catered to my request of ordering a cake as a birthday gift after the massage and they happily helped me out! They go way beyond and so so happy! As for the ambiance it is very calming and quiet, my bf immediately felt relaxed coming inside. The staff are very nice too! Thank you Erawan Thai massage! 😍 	The atmosphere was good and the spa is clean. Very friendly service and my therapist had very strong hands, however I felt there was a lack of technique and the distribution of time was not even. 85% of it was spent winding 2 knots in my shoulder with her elbows, which really is a shame as the 5 minutes spent on my legs was incredible.  I don’t think it’s good value for money, as we have had much better massages for a third of the price. 	Perfect relaxation and excellent service!  I had an amazing experience at this massage shop! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing, the staff is extremely friendly and professional. The massage itself was simply perfect – the ideal balance between relaxation and deep muscle relief. After the treatment, I felt completely rejuvenated! I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back. Absolutely five stars! 	I had an amazing experience! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was calming and inviting. The staff was incredibly welcoming and made sure I felt comfortable right away.  The massage itself was perfect—just the right amount of pressure, and I could feel the tension melting away. The therapist was professional, skilled, and really paid attention to my needs. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed.  Highly recommend! Don't be insecure because it's not central located. the stay is worth it. All the best.	Fantastic experience at this place. I opted for Head Back Shoulder Neck massage and it was handled expertly. They even helped me withdraw cash from nearest ATM because card wasn't working. 	A truly wonderful experience! The therapists are highly skilled, and the atmosphere is clean and relaxing. A perfect retreat for both body and mind. I highly recommend it to everyone! 	Amazing aroma oil massage! The atmosphere was calming, the therapist was skilled, and the oils smelled wonderful. I left feeling relaxed and refreshed. Highly recommend!🤩👏 … 	I have tried many Thai massages in Europe, but my favorites have always been the Erawan salons in Budapest! I am very happy that the international network is now available in Bankok! The place is very cozy, extremely clean, tidy, the receptionist is very helpful. The therapist lady massages extremely well, it was an excellent experience. Whenever I return to Bankok, I will definitely visit her. 	Highly skilled. Had a lovely relaxing aromatherapy and foot massage for 90mins. Lovely atmosphere soft music and lovely smell from the oils. And reasonably priced. A must go to place. Thank you so much 	One of the best full body oil massages I have ever gotten, the massage therapist at Erawan knew exactly what she was doing and was very considerate of my special needs!  I highly recommend it! 	I am delighted with the service. The masseurs are very kind and expert, and the massage was extremely relaxing and healing. I recommend this place to everyone! 	Best massage I’ve ever received in my life. If you enjoy a deep tissue massage ask for Apple, she will take great care of you 	A great foot and shoulder massage here. My 15 year old son joined for his first massage and loved it ! 	Another best massage shop in Bangkok. The masseuses are experienced, the shop is beautiful and clean. You won't be disappointed!!
