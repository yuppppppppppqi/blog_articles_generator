Highly recommend if you’re looking for a massage that will really help to get the knots out of your muscles. The staff was so friendly and kind. 	We had a great massage in a couple. The massage thai by the school. Every part of my body was massaged. Very knowledgeable and intense experience. Highly recommend it. 	Very good massage, highly recommend it. Very expert and professional staff! It’s a massage place where they know what a real Thai massage is, they don’t do it too strong or too soft, very detailed and precise work. I took the foot massage and was informed that the legs are equally important, so they massaged both, and I’m glad they did! When I left my feet and legs felt like they had forgotten all the walking I did while backpacking for a month. The owner is very social and will inform you about Thai culture if you inquire, you will learn about Thai culture while getting massaged if you want :)	This salon is perfect for those who truly want to experience the essence of Thai massage. At Sinee, Pitcure ı shared who is called One, I had one of the most intense yet beautiful massage experiences of my life from his hand. The massage was quite firm, but also incredibly relaxing and healing. It was completely different from anything I’ve tried before. This is a very local salon and, in my opinion, a hidden gem. If you’re looking for an authentic Thai massage experience, you should definitely visit this place. 	Lek did an amazing job! She has the hands of an angel. I felt like a new person after being under her caring, strong hands for one hour. And I think I will come back tomorrow. Highly recommend! 	Came here on the way to a tour to kill some time. Nice place hidden in a carpark. We both got the foot massage and it was really good. Mine was quite brutal, but they were very friendly and if it’s too much to handle, you can just tell them to tone it down a bit. Felt like more a local place, but they welcomed us and looked after us with open arms. One of the best massage experiences in Bangkok! 	Very nice foot massage. Very friendly staff. The entrance is located inside the parking garage for the badminton club, on the right hand side. Look for this sign 	I really needed a Thai massage and I was so happy to find this shop. The entrance is tucked in a parking lot but don’t let that deceive you. The massage therapist was very skilled. I would love to come back! 	Foot and leg massage was great! They were accommodating with doing only 30 minutes, for half the price. Entrance is at the sports complex, on the right hand side, facing the complex. Friendly staff! 	Wonderful experience! A hidden gem, you have to work to find it a bit but it’s well worth it. I got a foot massage and my mom got a full body massage and the two workers there did a great job! Thank you!	Really great massage! There wasn't any oil and you had to wear clothes given to you. I'm unsure if that's a custom here, but it was absolutely lovely! 	Amazing massage! Very comfortable, found every knot in my back and leg cannot recommend enough 	Great experience, left relaxed and happy. Shop is spacious and clean, staff is friendly. Intense and strong :) 	Best Thai message ever you can get in BKK If you want real professional thai message you have to try this one Professional, passionate, very polite	This was the best massage I ever had. Thank you 	Perfect massage and very professional, would recommend for all honeymooners ❤️❤️❤️ The girl was perfect Thankk youuuu guys 🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻 …	Very good massage, very clean and polite staff. They really know how to work your knots in your muscles. 	After she was done, I have no less than 5 stars to rate her excellent performance. Thank you for your work. 	Very good, very comfortable environment 	Perfect and best massage in BK, run perfect thanks a lot
