But when I arrived around 4:30 PM, I was told I had to leave by 6 PM because a male housekeeper was scheduled to clean the female onsen area for a private guest booking.  This was not only uncomfortable, but also unfair. As a paying public guest, I was rushed out simply because a private client was given priority—even though this is supposed to be a public onsen. The staff admitted this happens when private rooms are full, and they shift those guests into the public space instead.  It felt discriminatory and badly managed. To make things worse, it was pouring rain and I was left waiting with no transport. I came for relaxation and left feeling dismissed. I hope Yumoto reconsiders how it treats its public customers. 	I only tried the public onsen, so I can not speak to the other treatments. I got there shortly after it opened, so I had it to myself.  I found it relaxing. The hot pool was 40 C, and the cold pool was 14 C. The sauna was also quite hot but in a good way. 	Entry: 750TH All worth it in my opinion. Yes you can find cheaper 🫣🤣 Etiquette: Bucknaked Towels: Yes Water: Yes lemon zest flavour 🙏🏽 Sandals: Yes Sauna: Yes Steam: Yes Hot / Cold bath: Yes	Lovely spa with a peaceful and relaxing ambience. I had an aromatherapy massage which was perfect. A nice choice of three scents for the massage. The onsen and sauna area was very relaxing. It is a public onsen but i was very lucky to have it to myself.	Yumoto Spa is very very good. The environment is perfect, new ,clean, cozy. For men there’s a big hot water pool and a medium cold water pool. And also have a big sauna room. And the price is also reasonable.  Worth it. 	Very clean, with welcoming staff. Complimentary welcome drinks, tea, and fruit were provided. After the service, everything was handled perfectly. 	Recommend onsen spa 🧖‍♀️. I really enjoy and. Service is excellent 👍. Thank goodness … 	We had a great experience at Yumoto Onsen. The facility was super clean and hygienic. The staff was very friendly and attentive, anticipating every detail to ensure a relaxing visit. The massage was highly professional and customized to what you wanted. Even on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn’t crowded, allowing us to fully enjoy the serene ambiance. As a fun touch, the restrooms feature modern Japanese toilets! Overall, it was an amazing, refreshing, and truly zen experience. 	Very nice place, but onsen means natural water from ground. I lived in Japan 8 years, so O know the difference. The ambience is nice though. 	In the heart of chaotic Bangkok, Yumoto Spa & Wellness is a calm, clean and peaceful refuge. The staff are incredibly kind and the service is top-notch. I’ve been here several times and I’ll definitely be back. Highly recommended! 	the hot tub was 37.5c and extra shallow you cant really relax in there, the sauna was 65c, do thai have a different perception of hot tub sauna to the rest of the world? After reflecting to the manager, he arranged someone to turn up the temperature, they did turn up the sauna to 80, but something changed for the onsen. Dont call yourself a onsen/hotspring when the hotel bathtub is hotter than yours. 	Nice space, went on a Friday evening and had it to myself. It has a hot bath, a cold bath (extra cold) and a sauna, kind of like a sento. The price is a little high for just this, but it would be a nice add-on if you visit the spa. They should get rid of the wooden stools in the shower and just use plastic. 	Amazing place. So many amenities, very clean. Staff was very helpful in guiding a first timer. 	This place is very cozy. The massage is really good. for the onsen if you like private in weekday, I recommend because the people is not crowded. 	Part of the “Tribe Living Bangkok Sukhumvit 39” hotel. Non-hotel guests are of course very welcome. 	Best place to spend the day to recharge. The sauna, the steam room, all of the pools are all so lovely and the facility is spotless 	Best 4 hand massage i ever had!!! 	Glad to finally have an onsen on this side of Sukhumvit. It's nice. Two pools, a hot (40c) and cold (14c). They're both pretty big and can seat quite a few, but the place was pretty empty when I went on Sunday afternoon. The hot one has some jets in a few spots as well. It's gender separated and like normal, you have to be nude in the onsen. Some buckets to dump water on your head or on towels would be nice in here.  Sauna is a bit cold at 75c. This seems common at onsens in Bangkok but is well below what I've seen at Thai Saunas or in Japan. I have no idea why so many places keep them so cool. There are also no towels or pads to sit on in the sauna to keep your sweat off the seats, which is also common in Thailand, although they gave me three towels at reception. Maybe one is supposed to be for that.  Changing room is nice. Has a bathroom and some standup showers. Inside the onsen there are only sit down ones. There's a cooler of lemon water if you want a drink.  Reception is also nice and friendly. They were very accommodating taking my cash. They also offered a drink when leaving too, which i never see anywhere eledit: finally went back for a massage. It was good! 	Clean, new and good atmosphere 	Absolutely loved my visit to Yumoto Wellness Onsen and Spa! The atmosphere is tranquil, the hot springs are perfect, and the massage I received was one of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend this place for a relaxing getaway.
