They're having an opening promo of 600 baht for 1 hour massage in Dec 2024. The massage is super nice and soothing, and the masseuses are experienced. Able to really deep tissue our tension and loosened the knots.  As the place is quieter, they also accepted us even though we walked in. Not shady as well, though the beds are not as comfortable as it's a floor bed rather than a massage bed. Nevertheless, for its price point and effectiveness, it's super worth it and service was excellent too. 	The best Thai massage I've experienced 👍 i feel very relaxed and refreshed after the pressure massaged over my body. The staff are polite and kind, the manager also speaks even English and Korean very surprised me ! Highly recommend here Relief Relax and i'll come again for my next visiting BKK. … 	Wonderfull staff and therapists. Great atmosphere overall. Facilities and Spa looks nice and well furnished. They provide help and offer great service. Variety of options you can choose from at a decent price too. Definitely one of my favorite spa place in Bangkok would definitely recommend.	Recommended place to give a chance to speak for itself. Polite lady boss and friendly staffs. Clean environment n towels. Room temperature is just right. Definitely hope to see this place expand to a bigger space. 	If you are looking for a Thai massage I am highly recommend this place Relief Relax. The staffs and receptionist are friendly and polite also can speak in Korean, English and a little bit in Chinese 😁. My body felt relieved and relaxed. … 	Very good experience. Recommended Office Syndrome Massage for 90mins. The therapist provided a very excellent massage for me the staff also good service and polite. Highly recommend here!!! Relief Relax  👍🏼👍🏼 I’ll come again for sure ^^ … 	Working in the same gesture for many hours makes my whole body tense and stressed. I love massage, so I sometimes go massage. I tried this place for the first time. After one hour massage, it released my stress so well. I thought it's gonna be hurt like i went to other place before because of my severe tension. but surprisingly, it's super great. it might be hurt a little bit, but it's in the level that i can bear. i didn't shout like crazy like other place i went before. after this time i decided to go again monthly. moreover, the service was so wonderful. they washed my feet first. they were releasing my tension starting from my legs and so on. after massage, they served tea with sweet riped mango. in the end of the service, i talked to myself that this is worth to spend my salary lol. 	This place was just opened for around 8 months. The staff is friendly and massage here is superb. I went for 60min foot massage and they allowed me to customise with 10min shoulder. They also washed my feet with aroma oil and mineral salt. I was given a private room for 600 baht. I wanted to extend to 90min after experiencing the good massage skill but it was already fully booked 😅 go for it! Nice mango and fig tea to end off the session. 	Conveniently located but very little other redeeming qualities. I am a big girlie, not old and have been to tons and tons of massages over the years (Thai/Ayurveda/ Swedish/ Hammam , you name it) and this was by far my least favourite one.  I booked a 90 min herbal compress which the price was 2500 baht (understandably high as they need to pay rent).  However the massage was aggressively strong and despite asking for a softer touch it was like being roughed up on a rugby field. The compress itself was lukewarm and added very little to the effect. And to top it off when I told the masseuse it wasn’t feeling good, she laughed , which I think hurt me more.  I think you can do better by walking a few feet outside the building. Go do that. 	Had a 1.5hr foot massage here and it was so relaxing :) the massage includes a foot bath, private room where you can lie down while they do the massage, and a ~20min head and shoulders massage. At the end, they provide you with mango and tea. The service was excellent and massage was very relaxing. Their masseuse are very professional and experienced as well. Would come back again 	Highly recommend! The place very clean and calm. Staff very expert in massage. Foot massage recommend!! 	My second time visit already. Excellent leg massage. The therapist helped me stretched my legs and the muscle pain after sports and gym was gone on the next day. I also tried body massage last time, very good too. 	Very relaxing 60 min hot aromatherapy massage after a friend recommended this place. Service is great (also provided complimentary tea and mango), convenient location near BTS station and near a lot of the main shopping spots.  Highly recommend and will definitely come back 	The massage was incredibly relaxing and relieved all my tension—highly recommend! 	Good cost performance ! My friend recommended me this place it was amazing ! Masseuse very excellent highly recommend I'll come again for sure. 	The office massage was really good, targeting pain points of us who are often at the desk. Although it can be a bit painful (deep tissue pressure massage) during the session, I walked out of the room feeling lighter and better than when I entered. May not be as cheap as other shops along the street, but definitely worthwhile. Will come back again when I visit BKK. 	This massage parlor is very nice. Great service and staffs. Massage quality is worth pay. The shopkeeper also very nice. I come to them almost every month. Love the body scrub.🥰 … 	The massage was amazing. The masseuse hit all the right spots. It might be painful to some but that's what you will go through if you want to release the tension.  It's on the higher side in terms of price but that's what you pay for. It comes with quality. (: 	Entering the store for the first time, the atmosphere inside the store is great.  The inside looks clean and has all the equipment.  Excellent reception staff  The masseuse did a good job and felt relaxed.  Overall, everything is good and perfect	Highly recommended. Although it's slightly pricier than other places (paid 1290b for 1.5hr - 30 mins foot and 60 mins back), I felt like it was worth it!  Link (therapist) was excellent. My body felt better immediately!
