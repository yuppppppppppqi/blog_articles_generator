Everything was great from the moment that I came, throughout the massage and after care. Enjoyed it so much that I came for more two days later. This time I had reflexology foot massage. Pure bliss!!! Can't recommend it enough x 	Wonderful service and great people. Very welcoming. Me and my husband both did the hot oil aroma massage and it was amazing defo recommend when in Thailand. Will definitely be coming again 	Terrible massage do not go to this place! I wanted a nice relaxing massage but the masseuse had other plans there was no pressure at all and the person was doing some weird massage near my junk even when i specifically asked for a leg and lower back massage. I Felt very uncomfortable during the whole experience. If I could give a negative star I would. 	Such a great experience! Me and my friend opted for a full body oil massage and we were able to keep the curtain open between us to still have a joint experience - was really hygienic and professional and the members of staff are SO SO lovely!! Would highly recommend!! 	Having been in Thailand for two weeks, I had walked past many message opportunities. But this was my birthday and what a perfect day to try this local business. What a wonderful immersive body experience. My spouse and I were greeted by the owner. Two spots were available. We were led to two curtained rooms, side-by-side. Over the next hour my muscles were messaged carefully yet deeply. The session concluded with some selective body stretching all the while listening closely for any signs of discomfort. I left feeling refreshed and wishing I could make a visit to this business a weekly pleasure. Highly recommend. Very reasonable prices. 	Did a Thai massage for 299 baht and was very happy! Had other Thai massages in Thailand and this is one of the best! Their technique was very good 	Best massage is krabi !!!! You must try it! 	Best first Thai massage ~! Thank u oasis for making this experience wonderful ! Great massage & atmosphere ₊˚⊹♡ ✧˖° 	Tjuv was the best massage therapist I had a full body massage with 100% coconut oil it was super I really enjoyed the massage I recommend 	The best massage in Krabi, professional and welcoming! Will come back again. 	The best spa in Ao Nang. Have been there several times Professional staff and friendly service 🫶. … 	Nice massage! Body feel relieved n relax! Friendly staff. 	Great massage! Thank you for the warm welcome. 	Don’t go here, they don’t know what they are doing. We waited 30 minutes because they didn’t have enough people. Not relaxing waste of 800 baht	The worst massage i have ever seen in the world 	Had a very good massage from a friendly lady. Highly recommended for everyone! 	The shop is clean, the masseuses are good, and the service is very good. I would recommend this shop.
