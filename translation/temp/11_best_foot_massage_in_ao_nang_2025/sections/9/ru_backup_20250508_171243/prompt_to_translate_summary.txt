Massage is decently good but a bit pricey without promotion 	Amazing massage experience. I had 1h Thai full body massage from Ananta Burin resort and it was super relaxing and professional. You feel the experience and quality. The building is super clean and modern. 	So good. What a find!! Service was second to none....even after checkout. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Krabi! 	I don’t even know how to describe what that was xd an old masseuse during a coconut oil massage spent the first 40 minutes awkwardly rubbing various parts of my body. After that, she fell asleep over me XDD I got up and left, there was no point in enduring this drama for another 40 minutes. 	Massage was awful. I ask for a sport massage, but it wasn't. Soft oil massage only. No help, no english communication at all. Don't recommend at all. You could find better massage and 2-3 times cheaper then there 	We received 2 free massages with our booking as we booked direct. We also made use of their buy 1 get 1 free promo for aroma massage. The staff were friendly, welcoming and accepted that as a single adult travelling with 3 young children the toddler would be in the room with me. Easy booking procedure and would recommend. 	My family of four just had one of the best aroma wat pho oil massage, the ladies were really good. Very happy customers 	Loved the whole experience, the lady was brilliant, I had a balm and oil which was just what I wanted. Will be going again 	Great service. We felt so relaxed and loved the massage experience. It is worth the price. Heartily thankful to the staff members. Also the vibe at massage parlour was very peaceful and pleasant. 	Great massage place in Ao nang. The lady is really good. I feel extremely relaxed and calm after session. Also very low prices! 	Body massage was very good. They massage very well. I feel very relaxed. 	Relaxing and a bit painful as they massage your points deeply , a must try for a life time experience, good hotel as well	The manager so good in handling us and upgraded our room Thanks ya 	Best resortbfor families and groups. Lovely breakfast menu and in house massage house. Highly recommend to saty over 3 days 	The foot massage here is really really good, somewhat magical. My husband and I almost fell asleep during the massage. Would highly recommend. 	Came here for a back/neck and shoulders massage and found it to be decent. I requested a male masseur due to the strength difference I have noticed in Thailand and that was no issue.  My friend settled for a lady massuese due to no more males being available and she found her massage to be okay/nice as well.  The lady though she had kept opening the curtains between us and laughing and trying to converse with my masseur, which was a bit annoying to be honest. Upon the moment they were stretching my friend she opened the curtains again, after I myself closed them and my masseur seriously got flashed due to my friend's bare chest.  Since all the professionala got called after 4 people requested a massage I am assuming they have certain people on speeddile and whomever responses the quickest, gets the deal.  For the nice resort that they are I was expecting more professionalism from the masseuse.  I overall had a good massage, yet I do not need to see someone elses face and hear that curtain be opened 10times in a row after my masseur and myself closed it.  Focus on your own client, that might be a better work strategy. 	I am having the massage for 2nd time. The massuer is professional with skillful hands, perfect for relaxing after the tiring trip. I always been to Healthland for massage before, this is definitely better than that.
