The massage itself was excellent, and the therapists were highly professional and skilled. The place itself is modern and clean, which was a big plus.  However, there were a couple of significant drawbacks. First, I opted for a foot massage, but the chair I was seated in was not comfortable at all. Unlike other massage places where the chair reclines like a bed for maximum relaxation, this one didn’t recline at all, making it hard to fully relax.  Additionally, the ambiance was lacking. The massage area was right near the entrance, only about a meter and a half from the doorway, so I could hear street noise, conversations, and the comings and goings of staff and other customers. This lack of a calm, secluded atmosphere really took away from the relaxation experience.  Considering the higher-than-average prices, I expected a more tranquil setting that would allow for a better overall experience. While the massage quality was top-notch, the environment didn’t support the full relaxation I was hoping for.  In conclusion, while the massage therapists are excellent and the place is clean and modern, the lack of a comfortable setup and a peaceful ambiance makes it hard to fully recommend. I hope they can improve these aspects to offer a more holistic relaxation experience in the future. 	This salon is great.  Upon arrival, you will be greeted by a pleasant aroma and very nice staff.  The massage is definitely worth the price.  I feel very rested and the back pain I came with is gone.  The manicure is ok, but not perfect.  The gel polish peels off after 3 days. 	Love this place. The massage was 10/10 and the staff is super professional and sweet. The place is very clean! 	Head Massage and Foot Reflexology - 1 hour total with Kenny and my husband had a Coconut full body massage. 10/10 all around! Such a lovely spot but yet so inexpensive, would defo return! 	The place looks very good from outside, we had a Thai massage with oil , which was pleasant and relaxing. The staff is really friendly and helpful. It’s possibile to pay by card with a 3% fee. 	Ive been in Thailand many times. This is one of the best massage I ever had in my life. The place was clean and the therapist was very polite. Jenny managed to crack my back so well. Highly recommended. 	Really impressed with this massage place in Ao Nang. It’s super clean and has a peaceful atmosphere that makes you feel at ease right away. The massage itself was great—professional and well done without being too expensive. I’ve checked out a few places nearby, and this one definitely gives the best value for money. The staff are friendly and seem to know what they’re doing. If you want a solid massage in a tidy and chill environment, this is a great spot to go. Do not there is a 3% charge for credit card 	Absolutely wonderful traditional Thai massage. Great staff. Friendly and professional. Highly recommend! 	We passed by here randomly after lunch and decided to go in. So glad we did! The thai massage feels amazing, I got stretched and pulled in all kinds of ways but I feel so relaxed and my muscles are thankful we came here. Thank you ladies!! 	Amazing! Got the Thai full body massage and it was gentle but hard when needed. So relaxing inside and you are treated amazingly. Complimentary cup of tea at the end. Will definitely be back! 	I had a foot massage and it was awesome. Definitely worth the price. Ambiance was relaxing 🫶🏼 …	Beautiful, relaxing experience! I had a traditional Thai massage one day then soothing head, neck & foot massage another time. Definitely recommend- should have come here every day! 🙏🏻 … 	I had a wonderful massage....the staff was friendly and welcoming... Minuses was so wonderful that I would recommend her to anyone that is coming to this location. 	Beautiful relaxing massage. The massage therapists take their time and ensure you feel comfortable and relaxed. Very good price. The salon is beautiful and you feel calm as soon as you walk in. Very clean and hygienic aswell. You get a warm tea at the end of your treatment which is a very nice touch. Thank you 🤍 … 	Recommended!!! This is the second time we back to the shop with the new renovation. Cozy place to relax when come to Krabi. Very professional massage service and friendly staffs. We will back again when we come to Krabi. 	Very good massage with very good ambience. You can truly relax in this calming place with very little noise from staff or outside. Did the aloe Vera treatment and was spoiled with tones of cream on top of a great massage. 	Beautifying little spa! Staff was amazing and service was great! Highly recommend will be coming back before I leave for another massage. My daughter loved her manicure .
