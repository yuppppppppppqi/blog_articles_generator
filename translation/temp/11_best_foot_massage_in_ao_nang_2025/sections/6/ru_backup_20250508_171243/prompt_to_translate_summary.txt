My first time going for a full body massage. Verified this place is super nice, clean and decent. The masseurs are well trained, professional, and able to speak good English. We took the full body oil massage, cost us 400 bhat. For tourists, give this shop a try. It’s not on the main road, so it has less visibility. Visited this shop on 18 March 2025 and the owners invited monks for chanting at their shop. 	Absolutely fantastic experience! The salon is clean, peaceful, and very welcoming. I had several massages here during my stay in Krabi, and each one was amazing. Sindy is incredible - she really understands the body and knows exactly how to relieve tension.  My husband also had a great experience with Ann and couldn’t stop raving about how good his massage was. The entire staff is friendly and professional. Highly, highly recommended if you're looking for a quality massage in a clean and relaxing environment! 	Wonderful place! Did foot, head and shoulders massage - number one masseur! Wonderful relief after visiting Tiger cave and 1260 steps up one way :D next to Deevana hotel, so if you stay here - you must to visit this place ♥️ 	Nice place, Friendly staffs Especially P’ Bee .. she’s very nice and kind. Love it here, I will come back again next time:) 	I got a body scrub and it was amazing! The scrub was with coffee after which a hydration cream with a short massage session. The place is clean, staff is super kind, the whole atmosphere is inviting to relax and unwind. Great experience overall. 	We had a great massage! They really understand the body’s needs. The staff is kind and professional. The salon is clean, modern, and well-maintained. Highly recommend! 	best massage i have ever had. nothing else even comes close. i have been to thailand 18 times and have had lots of massages. 	Visited few times, brand new clean facilities, very friendly staff. Excellent strong massage by Sinny.
