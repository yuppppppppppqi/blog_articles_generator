I and my husband had a long vacation in thailand which ended today with the special thai massage provided by Natalie and Fai. My husband had back pain considering that natalie gave a professional massage accordingly. Fai was a sweet lady with expertise in massage who helped me relief my foot pain. Overall great experience 👌🏼 	Best massage in town! Highly recommended! Great service and lovely staff! 😁 too bad I have to go back to California tomorrow. If not I will come back for sure. This is the best massage place in krabi. if I have a chance to give them more star, I will give them extra five more star. overall,My massage lady name Katie. so far she’s the best massage lady I ever have in Thailand. 	Wow!!!!! Wow !!! Wow !!! it was the most amazing massage we had in all our vacation!!!! And we did a lot :) but this massage is unforgettable! So professional Great and welcoming staff! Thank you so much for that treatment! 😍🥹🙏🏻 	Natalie gave me an amazing aloe vera massage that helped soothe my sunburn. She was absolutely fantastic. Very clean and well kept salon. Would highly recommend! 	We had a disappointing experience at velar Massage. While their rates match the market, the service quality is poor, especially for Indian customers. Only a 1 or 2 therapists seemed skilled, and each massage felt inconsistent. Customer service was unhelpful, and their packages felt manipulative. There are much better options in Thailand. Would not recommend. 	Fixed me right up! I was staying at the Centara Hotel opposite, and was training at the Khunsuek Muay Thai gym daily. I had multiple longstanding sprains and injuries before my visit to Thailand ranging from ankle, hip, shoulder, neck and elbow. I discussed my ailments with the receptionist and he advised on best massage therapy, which would still allow me to train. I opted for the symptomatic massage. This was an incredibly deep tissue massage, not for the faint hearted as there were elbows and knees being dug into muscles to soften them up and release knots. However, once the massage was finished, I felt fantastic and was able to train Muay Thai with less niggles. At the end of my Krabi trip, I had my second systematic massage and am currently writing this review without a single ache in any of the aforementioned injury spots. If you find yourself in Ao Nang, please check Velar Massage out, you will not regret it! 	Really loved the professional massage which was given by the amazing therapist. It’s a must try if you are in Krabi, they are best at it. 	Great massage place! Cozy atmosphere, gentle yet precise therapists, and super relaxing massages. The price is reasonable, and the service is so good that I’d definitely come back! 	Had a fantastic thai massage with oil from Natalie. Mama was ready for some me time and I came out feeling like a new woman! Great massage, perfect place, good price. Thank you Natalie! :) 	Best massage to go to in Krabi.. Both us when back to back days while we were there.. We tried both full body and foot massage.. The people there are so friendly and their skills are great.. Don't waste your time trying other massage on the street as the price is the same range.. Recommended.. Will definitely come back again here 	Had an amazing experience at Velar Massage in Krabi! My masseuse, Venn/Wenn, was fantastic—skilled, professional, and very attentive. We opted for a foot massage (45 mins) and a neck & shoulder massage (60 mins), and both were incredibly soothing and relaxing. The ambiance was calm, the staff and the people at front desk were friendly, and the rates were reasonable. Overall, a perfect spot to unwind after a long day. Highly recommended! 	Had one of the best massages iv ever had here. Very relaxing atmosphere friendly staff who know what they are doing. The only place i go to now for massages. Very reasonable price as well definately cant recommend this place enough. 	This place is a complete rip-off. They deceive tourists by placing extra footwear outside to make it seem like they're busy, but in reality, they have no clue about proper massage techniques. They randomly assign you to someone who clearly lacks training, apply any cream they have, and just go through the motions without actually providing a real massage. It’s nothing but a waste of money and time.  If you're looking for a proper massage, skip this place and head to Wayreach Massage, just 350 meters away. They charge the same but actually know what they're doing! Even they don't respect indians 	Best I've ever had. Lovely staff, very clean and definitely recommend 	Clean and tidy shop with friendly staff. I had a 60min essential oil whole body massage. The masseur was friendly and professional. The massage was delivered the right amount pressure and care. 450 bht Not the cheapest but definitely more professional 👌 	I had the back and shoulder Massage. Natalie was very lovley and did a amazing job. I felt so good after her Massage. Thank you so much 😊 … 	Great foot massage. Smells very nice inside and quiet ambience. Daytime best for visiting
