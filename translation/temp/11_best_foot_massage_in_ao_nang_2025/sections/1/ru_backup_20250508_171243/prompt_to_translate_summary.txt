The atmosphere is relaxing, the service is excellent, and overall, it’s a place where you truly enjoy spending time.  I’d especially like to highlight Mon, the massage therapist who worked with me—she did an amazing job! The massage was fantastic, and I left feeling completely refreshed.  Another great convenience is that the salon accepts card payments, which is really helpful.  Highly recommend this place! I will definitely come back. Trip type Vacation Service: 5 Location: 5	Had the most amazing traditional massage and foot massage. Worth the little trek off the beaten path. All the staff are lovely and you get little complimentary bits at the beginning before choosing and afterwards with a nice drink, crackers and hot flannel. If I could give 10 stars I would. 	Such a professional and lovely place! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, and the staff is incredibly skilled and welcoming. I can say this was the best massage I had in Thailand.  A special thank you for the after-massage cookies and tea—such a nice touch! If you’re looking for a high-quality massage, this is the place to go. I’ll definitely be back next time ❤️ Trip type Vacation Travel group Couple Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights Quiet, Great value 	During my trip, I visited this massage salon several times, and it became a special place for me to relax. I tried back massages (three sessions), an office retreat massage, hot coconut oil and aloe massage, a facial, and a pedicure. The salon made a great impression, and I will really miss this place. I hope to come back next year.  The atmosphere is wonderful: everything is very clean, cozy, and made with care. The staff are kind, friendly, and professional. Each therapist I had - worked in their own unique way, and all the treatments were excellent.  The only issue I had was during one back massage. The therapist seemed like she didn’t want to be there — her movements were slow and without energy, like she was just waiting for the session to end. That made the hour feel a bit tiring for me too. But I understand this can happen, and all my other experiences were amazing.  Overall, I highly recommend this salon. Thank you for your care and professionalism! Trip type Vacation Travel group Friends Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	Went to Massage Corner for traditional hot coconut oil massages, along with my brother and sister… Our therapists were Mon, Tuk and Pop; they were all great! The pressure was was awesome! Loved the location too, very accessible. Please do give Massage Corner a try, if you’re in Ao Nang! Trip type Vacation Travel group Family Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights Great view, Quiet, Great value 	Excellent massage by all standards. The best I’ve experienced. I highly recommend this place. And especially my therapist AL Ta! :)  I told her about my knee injury and she took special care to ensure the pain was better. She was very technically sound and knew exactly what to do. Im super impressed by this place, will come back again! Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	Amazing service, from beginning to end. Very welcoming. Staff very kind. I got the body scrub with massage for 120 minutes. The best massage experience I have ever received. Thank you massage corner!!!	Must try the foot massage! It takes place outside on the soft sofa chairs, so you have the beautiful greenery and sounds of nature around you, with a perfectly comfortable temperature with the fan on, and Thai spa music. The holistic … More 	Easy to find location and very hospitable staff. The entire process was smooth and well thought about… And the menu of options for massage was clear and detailed. Affordable prices; Very kind and welcoming staff; And amazing service.  We will be coming again! Thank you for making our first trip to Thailand memorable and our first authentic Thai massage a great experience! Rooms: 5 Service: 5 Location: 5 	I booked a 90 min package called Office Syndrome.  I really liked the message. The lady doing the massage was very attentive, gentle and made sure I was feeling comfortable.  After the massage I felt extremely relaxed and my body felt more free. It was my first massage experience and I would definitely want to repeat it. 	Highly recommended! ♥️  The best place to get a massage in Krabi. My wife and I took the essential oil massage and we had the best experience. We requested them to have the massage with a view they had and they were so kind to provide us. The staff was so polite and their massage was also the best. It was like a ride in heaven. They gave us a nice tea after the massage as well which was really delicious and unique. This place is too good to be true. If you are there, don't miss out. The location is a little bit far and a small slope, so if you are going by a walk, you might need some energy but it's still worth it. 😊 	Stopped in with three friends after a long trip around Thailand! We needed a relaxing day and we got it! Everyone was friendly, welcoming and the overall experience was great. I definitely would recommend coming by when you’re in town! 	This is a massage place. Definitely the best one I’ve come across in Thailand. It’s not crowded enough because it’s not on the main road. But the masseurs knew their stuff well and we had the best experience so far. It was so relaxing that I slept during the massage and post the massage, felt super refreshed both mentally and physically (my skin was glowing!!) definitely worth a visit in ao nang? 	Fantastic massage place. It feels traditionally Thai and not overly luxurious. Simple. They allow you fill a consultation form before your massage which is nice to be able to tell them how intense the massage should be. my masseuse also spoke well enough English to allow me communicate during the massage and was attentive. The atmosphere is calm as well not chaotic at all and it was easy to relax. 	I had a sports massage and it was the best I’ve ever had. It his was my first massage in Thailand and I’ll be coming back for sure. 5 stars. Thank you very much. 	A totally different experience compared to the many "touristic" massage shops around the beaches. In Corner massage we understood immediately a higher level of customer care and kindness, totally worth to pay a little bit more to have a way better experience. Fully recommended!! 	Lovely foot massage! They provide a cool towel and cup of water when you arrive and they wash your feet for you before you enter. The vibe is very relaxing, the room for foot massages is open air with a fan (no AC) and looks out at lovely trees so you can hear birds and see squirrels. At the end they provide tea and cookies as well. Very clean and worth the walk away from the busy main street.
