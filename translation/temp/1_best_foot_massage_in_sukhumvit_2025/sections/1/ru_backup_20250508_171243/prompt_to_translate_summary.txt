Tried the foot massage today and regret not doing the full body. The massage therapist was really good and focused on the pressure points. Definitely coming for the body massage soon. A hidden gem that offers excellent customer service with beautiful done interiors. Also loved the after massage cafe which had some lovely mini treats,  coffee and tea of your choice. Overall I really enjoyed my session today. Definitely coming again. Thank you to the team at Eden.	The service here is phenomenal! Without a doubt, this is the best massage and spa in Bangkok. The staff are incredibly kind, and the facilities are both modern and impeccably clean. It is definitely worth the price for the quality of the service and the experience ur getting.	Words can express how amazing Eden ultimate spa and massage is! When i tell you they great you and treat you like your the only one there is amazing! The massage itself was the best full body massages i ever had! Let me just show some pics!!! 	The massage techniques were very professional, the therapist was attentive, and the environment was clean and pleasant. It was a very relaxing experience—highly recommended! 	It was my first Thai massage for 60 minutes. I requested for ‘soft’ intensity and it was perfect. She also pressed more gently in which I indicated ‘sensitive’ among my body. The atmosphere was also calm, bright, clean and quiet which made it very good to relax before and after the massage. Definitely will go again with friends. 	Omg best Thai massage ever. Even offered free shuttle from Aria hotel. Excellent customer service. Lovely atmosphere. Even got a gift at the end! 	Had an amazing experience at Eden Spa. Highly recommend. Hubby and I did the eden signature body balance. It was very relaxing ☺️ Totally worth it!! Ambience and quality of massage were totally worth it!! ♥️♥️♥️ 	I just had a full body massage at Eden The Ultimate Spa And Massage Experience, and it was absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by how clean, elegant, and serene the entire facility was. The ambiance set the tone for what turned out to be an incredibly relaxing experience.  The customer service was top-notch—warm, professional, and attentive to every detail. They made me feel completely at ease from start to finish. The massage itself was exceptional—one of the best I’ve ever had. The therapist was highly skilled and intuitive, ensuring the pressure and techniques matched exactly what I needed.  One of the nicest touches was the way they help you unwind afterward. They offer a lovely selection of drinks including coffee, tea, and juice, along with an array of snacks to enjoy while you relax and slowly ease back into the real world. It’s the kind of thoughtful detail that truly sets them apart.  If you’re looking to treat yourself or just need a moment of calm, I can’t recommend Eden enough. It truly lives up to its name. 	Awesome service. The atmosphere was also so relaxing. I actually slept while having my massage here which isn't always the case.  Thanks to all the staff and their hard work! 	Hidden gem SPA with extremely good services. They offer pick up service from Nana station. We had a private roof top all for ourself. The massage pressure was right to the point. I will recommend to my friends if stay around this area. 	Had an excellent spa day here and this was such a great find close to our hotel! We did the ultimate heavenly massage for 4 hours and enjoyed every bit. The staff was welcoming and polite and our masseuse were so good. We will be back before we leave Bangkok! 	Friendly staff, good service for the bus transfer to BTS Nana, a good and relaxing spa environment with a lovely snack bar spot. The masseur has good strength for their job. 	I had a wonderful morning at Eden, glad I walked the 20 mins up here for this experience.  Unlike the run of the mill massage shops that are everywhere here, this one is unique in that they cater to your individual needs.  I liked the quick form you fill out where you can pinpoint which areas of your body need focus, as well as pick the level of pressure.  Then masseuse really nailed my preferences, she was great.  And first class all the way inside, comfortable rooms, beverages and slippers, and after massage snack bar, and exceptional service from the staff.  Would gladly return :) 	Great experience🥰🥰 Recommended and very courteous, polite and kind personnel. I really appreciate the massage therapist who really gives best effort to deliver her service. Also there are food like teas and coffees they offer after your massage. It was a must try when u visit Thailand. Great facilities, customer service and affordable one. 	Beautiful place and very reasonable prices, lovely people and massage, if you are looking for couples massage this is perfect 	I went to Eden the Ultimate Spa and Massage with my wife, and it was the best massage experience we've ever had. From the moment we walked in, we felt like VIPs. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, and the spa itself was clean and luxurious. We both got foot massages and Thai oil massages, and they were both amazing. The masseuses were skilled and professional, and they really knew how to relax our muscles. We spent two hours at the spa, and it was the best two hours we've spent in Thailand. The spa is so relaxing and peaceful, and we left feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated. They also offered us some complimentary snacks and coffee, which was a nice touch. If you're looking for the best massage in Thailand, I highly recommend Eden the Ultimate Spa and Massage. It's worth every penny. 	This place is a real gem, the place was super clean and neat. Very professional & the massager did a wonderful job, I felt so light and relaxed. They also offered a few snacks after the session, a great gesture. 	Respectful Spa that has a menu to suit all ages male and female, the oil massage was one full hour beats any price in the UK, very affordable for me....give it a go you will want to come back again and again. 	The service is very good. We took the aroma therapy massage for couple. They were excellent. Clean and beautiful place. After service is incredible with mini lounge for snack and hot drink.	I had best thai massage ever at Eden Spa on my birthday. Staffs are professional. The room I was accommodated was good. My therapist was great. First time I really enjoyed Thai massage that much. I will come back on next trip to Bangkok.
