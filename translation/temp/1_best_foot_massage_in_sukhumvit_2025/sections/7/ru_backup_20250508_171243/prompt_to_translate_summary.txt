It cost 500 baht which I think is beyond I expected. I totally fall asleep and really enjoyed it. After the massage there’s a plate of fruits and veggies rather than sweet mango 🥭 with rice. I think is great too .  Anyways I will be back again ! Also recommend any of you if you are expecting to have a normal price and great service. 	Amazing Swedish massage 💆‍♀️ I have ever had!! Omg the lady I had her name is ok ✅ and so I will go back to her because I love the way she was pounding on me!!  It was so so good!! My friend from Canada 🇨🇦 was in and she got the oil aroma therapy and was so happy with her experience as well!  To drop it off to give you a little yogurt yummy dish with fresh fruits in it as a refreshing after massage  and they give you a tea before the massage!  I love the water rubs they bring to wash your feet!! 👣  Hi this place I’m going back for sure I will get the sweetest massage the  Swedish one and see if I can get one for two hours it was amazing truly it was so good!  OK so my fellow foodies I’m also gonna share my massage experience - incredible make sure you follow us here as well as social media channels trying to grow our database for new fellow foodies that want to try and experience amazing restaurants in Bangkok!!  🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸🌺🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 	A small, but well staffed professional massage venue. Therapist K. Pook gave me a Swedish massage with a focus on a stiff/locked shoulder per my request. The massage was good and was highly effective in unlocking my normal range of motion and relaxing my muscles. My wife opted for the hot stone therapy. She enjoyed the massage and said she was very relaxed afterwards.  I highly recommend going here for therapeutic massage.	My first foot and shoulder massage here and I had the therapist Ratsamee. She is so gentle yet skilled in her massage. I had a lot of tension from work but she massaged it all away. The price is also affordable and place is clean and nice. Thank you and hope to come again!	I recently had an aroma massage at Eszence, and it was nothing short of magical. It didn’t just soothe my body—it brought a deep sense of inner peace and healing. The care and hospitality I received were truly out of this world. I’m so grateful for the experience and already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Eszence, for such a soulful touch!🌼❤️ 	For someone who goes to massages very often i can tell the difference between a good one and one that’s not really it. If you come for a relaxing massage, very much recommend. The staff is extremely friendly and you get a nice drink as a starter with included information what it’s good for. At the end you also recieve a nice tea with some fruit and yogurt. Hospitality 10/10. 	This was the far best massage I've ever had in my ENTIRE life 🤯 K. Arty for me and my mom had Ice. They were not only thorough and so experienced but also nice and caring. We were both sooo satisfied and walked out with big smiles! Wish we found this place earlier so that we could visit twice 🥲 (and they were also very accommodating and understanding when I had to cancel for the first time due to the heavy traffic on the road!!) 	Great service. So nice and accommodating. You start with a cold tea before your service. I got the office syndrome with oil. Just what I needed after the long plane ride. At the end she cracked my neck and back. Then you finish with a hot tea and yogurt. I'll definitely go back again before I leave. 	Exceptional place! Everyone was so professional and kind, the place was also very clean and relaxing. They served a cold tea at the start, and fruit with yoghurt and a hot tea at the end. I got the office syndrome with oil massage and it was sooo relaxing and just what I needed! Highly recommend 	They served different types of tea (with benefits description) before and after the massage and also ended with a plate of salad. Masseuse was skilled and generally the crew were all super nice! Very pleasant experience! 	This place is amazing and a great service! I had foot scraping and pedicure. They did a fantastic job for make my feet looks natural and more glossy. I’m impressed with their professional works. Highly recommended! 	My fiancé and I came here for a herbal oil Thai massage. And in one word it was fantastic! Ja O was really attentive and expert at her craft. Will definitely come back soon! 	It was such a welcoming place and I felt so relaxed. The staff are super sweet and attentive.  Left feeling luxurious and pampered. They have used the space so efficiently. My 1st ever Thai massage and it really lived up to the name. Highly recommend this place. No wonder they have such good ratings. Hope to back the next time I visit Thailand. 	Had a very good aroma massage by senior therapist Ja-O! The massage was firm and so relaxing. I will come back again and again since they accept bookings on Whatsapp. Worth the price! 	I will give zero stars if i could. I wanted to have one hour Thai  massage while the receptionist told me that it is too short for a full body massage so she was kind of pushing me to confirm a 90 minute massage. However, after telling her that I only have one hour before going to the airport she was asking me to book 30 minutes head massage +30 minutes foot massage instead. Which, was almost double the price. Even paying more, I was not having a good experience since the massage was below average and I was getting annoyed at the meantime Funny enough, while I was paying and complaining, the receptionist finally told me that she asked me to book another program was because the bed was fully occupied while I entered the shop. So irresponsible and it was such a waste of time and money 	Wow it’s fantastic. I got Senior Masseuse Toy and I have never had such a good Thai massage in my life. 90 minutes well spent and everyone was super kind, they let me have a shower, and they gave me a delicious tea in the end. A must try 	Me and my husband said the same idea about this massage experience, “it’s the best massage I’ve had ever!!”, I thought I tried so much in my life, but this experience was so wonderful, highly recommend…⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 	Professional staff, clean, and calm environment. Nui was an exceptional masseuse. Tea before, after, & a tasty salad after was icing on the cake :) I higly recommend this spa when in Sukhumvit, Bankok! 	I loved every minute of the appointment. Everyone here is so kind, so helpful and always smiling. The atmosphere is very relaxing, really quiet and peaceful. My masseuse Joy was AMAZING! I will definitely come back again! 	Very satisfying experience. Staff members are nice and friendly. My massage was very therapeutic! The massage lady knows well about what she's doing, even though she has almost killed me with the pain!!! 😆 But I feel like reborn now 🤣🤣🤣 …
