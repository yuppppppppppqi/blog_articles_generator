One More Thai Massage (Phrom Phong)	4.9	1338	https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE	https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8	<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=place_id:ChIJz7LPO3qf4jAR_71zE1q5ihE&zoom=17&key=AIzaSyBFw0Qbyq9zTFTd-tUY6dZWTgaQzuU17R8' width='600' height='450' style='border:0' allowfullscreen='' loading='lazy' referrerpolicy='no-referrer-when-downgrade'></iframe>	Overall, the massage is good but the deducting point is there’s no foot washing before the massage, the masseurs merely use wet cloth to clean your feet. I wish this can improve as it’s the basic! The place is nicely renovated and kept. Receptionist Ms Pim and masseurs Ms Mam and Tar are very nice, polite and always put on smiling face! They are considerate to keep our drink and fruits which we brought to be put into the fridge and returned to us after the massage. That’s a good service! We have an hour back massage + 15 min back massage with herbal compress ball, also we have an hour Thai massage with herbal compress ball. It’s very relaxing and it heals our back and shoulder pain with the herbal compress ball. At the end of the massage, we are given the compress ball and to re-use it at home, this is very good as most massage shops don’t give it to the customer even thought we paid for the compress ball. Another disappointing part is we saw their website promotion advertisement which has a 14% discount from Tues to Thursday and we came on Thursday but after we arrived the shop, we are told that such promotion has ramped down so we are not able to enjoy, hope that the company marketing can revise the website so that the customers are no longer being mislead. I’ll keep my 5 stars to the massage shop for their awesome  service. 	Overall is was an amazing experience! We had the Thai massage+ herbal essence treatment and we were really satisfied with the experience :) The masseuses were very kind, experienced and had an amazing technique! Also, when you arrive in the store, you are welcomed with sweet tea and treats, and once the massage is over they give you the herbal treatment as a gift 😊👍🏻 I really recommend this place :) 	Highly recommend this place. Very clean and quiet. I think many of the massage parlors in Bangkok are located by the roadside and have poor noise insulation. Inevitable you will hear some traffic noise. There was quite minimal if that thankfully (I’m still reeling from a bad experience at another massage parlor with non stop renovation sounds) The therapist was attentive and strong and tried her best to manipulate my stiff tissues and bones. 	The therapists’ massage skills were average. The terrified was the bed bugs.  We killed one bed bug with blood when we were having our after massage tea with gummy. We faster left the massage place and disinfected our bags and clothes when we returned the hotel.	The massage session simply awesome, i had a relaxed body after that. The environment is good, relaxing and calm. Their service was tip top and accomodating. Will surw back again in future. 	If you’re searching for the best massage in town, look no further than the serene oasis that combines expert techniques with a soothing ambiance to leave you feeling completely rejuvenated. Hot stone to aromatherapy, their highly skilled therapist like CO2 Aoy, tailor each session to meet your specific needs, ensuring the ultimate relaxation and stress relief. The luxurious spa environment, complete with calming music and aromatic scents, enhances the experience, making it a true escape from the pressures of daily life. Whether you’re easing muscle tension, recovering from a workout, or simply indulging in self-care, this is the place where your mind and body will thank you. Discover the unparalleled quality and care that have earned this spot its reputation as the town’s finest massage destination. The tea and jelly at the end was a sweet touch to the relaxing atmosphere. I personally booked through Klook. CO2 Aoy you have a therapeutic touch and relieved my stress from a very long flight! I will be back . 	Quite a decent Thai oil massage experience. The comfort level is quite high but with the price range we are paying, we were expecting a private room with a nicer setting. Recommend booking online in advance. 	You can try to pre-book the massage services online, as you can find some good deals. Otherwise if you walk in, availability may vary and even by paying the full price, I would say it is reasonable.  Masseur was good, you can let them know to reduce strength and they will adjust accordingly.	This was a really good place for Thai Massage. The masseuse was super good at what she does - me with my low pain tolerance, she was able to match my level to make sure I was comfortable enough for the massage (note - Thai massage is not a gentle stroke to help you relax 😅). Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped in all the way to us leaving. Worth booking if you are ever in this area 👍🏻 Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 	This is the massage that I have been looking  and wanting for so long. It’s worth the travel as we stay at Silom. Therapists are all well trained and knows what real massage is. Will be coming back again for sure. Thank you 	loved the convenience of booking my massage via klook - this location did not require me to call after purchasing my voucher and i was able to book directly on klook. price is also competitive!  was surprised there was no feet wash prior to the massage but otherwise the massage was of great quality. this location would not be suitable for those with mobility issues as the rooms are located on the upper floors with rather narrow staircases. the bed was wide and comfortable, the clothes were of good quality (hope they can provide more plus sizes in the future). very happy w my massage and would most likely return :) 	Feel like in the heaven again, you have to try it and bring your family come together 	A wonderful experience. I had Som as my masseuse for my aromatherapy massage. It was definitely one of the top massages I have ever had, and the best massage I had for a long time. She knew where my tired muscles are and worked really hard on them. Thank you so much for the amazing two hours! I will definitely be back. 	Love the place! So clean and beautiful! All therapists are very skilled. I'm impressed every time I come. I've tried every programs and they're all good. I love Thai body massage + herbal compress and oil massages because they use good products. And I am not allergy to products even I have sensitive skin. 	The BEST thai massage! Definitely not something to miss when in Thailand. The service was great and the staff were very accommodating. There's also hot tea and free ice cream taste after the massage. I would definitely come back!! So worth it! 😊 … 	Very good. We have herbal and thai massage for 60 mins. The massage is great. They even give us the herbal compress ball and a pack of ingredients for tea as gifts. 10/10, definitely will bisit again 	I tried traditional massage with herbal ball massage for 2 hours! Just so nice and the environment made me feel so relax.  Nearby Phrom Phong BTS station, 5-8mins walking distance!	If you’re looking for authentic thai massage and you prefer medium/strong massage that can have beneficial effects on your body, this would be the place to go. I’ve have already tried a few massage places, and this place by far met my expectations. The reception also assured that I could choose to change my masseuse within 15 mins and that they are all certified annually. Highly recommended to completer your thai experience in BKK 	Clean environment. Professional service. I did a 1h 30min Thai massage. It’s easy to book and pay online. 🙏 … 	Went to the phrom phrong outlet. Highly recommended, the massage is not painful and it hits you with all the points. I wanted to sleep so badly. The herbal compress is a must do, highly recommended.
