My therapist, Ms. Tim, was incredibly skilled—she worked out all my knots and made me feel completely relaxed. The atmosphere was so soothing, and I really appreciated the attention to detail throughout the session.  Honestly, it was one of the best massages I’ve ever had! I left feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the world. I can’t wait to come back every time I’m in Bangkok. If you’re looking for a great spa experience, I highly recommend checking this place out! 	Very nice atmosphere and service. I’d love to come back here. We all loved it. Thank you so much for ur work. ———————————————————- I really-visited this same place after I really loved it. However the lady Ive had for the Thai massage had HORRIBLE skills, I had a painful time for 1 1/2hrs. I still have so much pain in my back, legs and arms. I think she doesn’t know how to massage or maybe she doesn’t wanna work at all. Also, she left for few mins twice during the massage, didn’t know why? And she rubbed my skin horribly without any oil or water, i felt so so much irritating on my skin. It was the WORST experience in bangkok. 	Nice and quiet place for relaxation and health massage. My masseuse Kaew and she did a very good Thai massage, relaxing and strong. A cup of herbal tea is served after the massage.	My husband and I were looking for a foot massage and this lovely gem was right around the corner from our hotel. The facilities are clean and warmly lit, music is relaxing, and all staff were very kind and hospitable. The room where the foot massage took place is cozy. Pang (my massage therapist) was very sweet and had even asked if I get cold easily and she offered me a seat where it was warmer. This was my first foot massage and I was scared at first but it felt amazing! Pang was great— I highly recommend her. I would come again if I ever visit Bangkok again! 	Hidden gem in Bangkok that everyone must try. Highly recommended for those who look for massage with sophisticated skills that relief stress and muscle pain. The price is really cheap compared with those fancy spa, while the quality of massage delivered is beyond our expectation. Highly recommended! 	Finally experienced the long-awaited Thai massage! The masseuse's techniques were professional, the pressure was just right, and my whole body felt completely relaxed. It significantly relieved my shoulder and neck soreness—highly recommend it to my friends! 	Don is so good, best forever. Its first time I experience such intense massage. I feel so relexed. I ve been here for 4 times almost everyday I stayed in bankok. My wife also likes here. This place makes us want to stay longer in bankok. 5 star. 	Excellent service, propper traditional Thai massage done by fully trained professionals.. leaves you both relaxed and rejuvinated at the end..  They were happy to accommodate my request to mix 2 massages in to the time I booked. 	Excellent massage. Been going for close to a year now and everything from the foot massage to the full body Thai massage has been perfect. The wife and I do not go anywhere else now that we have found this place. Highly recommend and very affordable for Bangkok near Sukhumvit. 	Have a good good experience in Health Massage. Ms. Pang is a skilled massage therapist, she impressed me with her skill. This is my first time here, and i will be back again in the future 💗 … 	Visited in weekday afternoon. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. I love the warm welcome from the boss. P’Pang is my massager, she provided excellent service to me and i really enjoyed the time with her. Definitely worth the money and I will surly visit again. 5 stars! 	The masseuse was really good at foot massage. Room was nice and dark so I could relax on massage chair. Reasonable price and Christian owned business, will definitely come back here for quality service next time! 	I had an extremely relaxing hour and a great body massage here, the price is very cheap compared to the value received, Ms Nanny is so amazing, enthusiastic and thoughtful, i love there 	Reasonable price at 350 baht / 1 hr thai massage, therapist Par has nice strength and technique. Location is a bit distant from BTS. 	Whenever I visit Bangkok, Healthy Massage is at #1 on my list. Today, Jam treated me, and as always, they were professional and friendly. I will definitely be back. 	Best massage in town when you're in Bangkok! Be sure to visit them and have masseuses Fah and Tim work their magic to relax your body. Will definitely visit again next time! 	Tanam and Anya provided very good oil massage for us. It's so relaxing and want to back again.	Today I had a foot massage service with a staff named Noey. She provided excellent service. I would like to recommend her and this massage shop. Thank you so much 	I had an incredible experience at Healthy Massage Sukhumvit 33 in Phrom Phong. From the moment I walked in, the environment was welcoming, clean, and relaxing, setting the perfect mood for a rejuvenating session. The ambiance was calming, with soothing music and a well-maintained space that immediately made me feel at ease.  A special mention to Don, the therapist who worked on me. She is truly a master of her craft—highly skilled, intuitive, and attentive. Her technique was precise and effective, ensuring that every pressure point was addressed with the right balance of strength and comfort. What impressed me the most was her ability to make me feel completely at ease while lying face down, adjusting the pillows and positioning with such care that I could fully relax and enjoy the massage without any discomfort.  Her deep tissue work was exceptional, relieving tension and knots without causing unnecessary pain. She also checked in regularly to ensure the pressure was just right, demonstrating her professionalism and experience. I left the session feeling lighter, more refreshed, and completely recharged.  If you're looking for a high-quality massage in Bangkok, I highly recommend Healthy Massage Sukhumvit 33, and if you have the chance, ask for Don—you won’t be disappointed! I'll definitely be returning on my next visit. 	One of my best massage! You can trust this place is "real Thai massage" with no hidden agenda. I had head&shoulder and therapist, Khun Leeya was able to fix my issue. Highly recommend.
