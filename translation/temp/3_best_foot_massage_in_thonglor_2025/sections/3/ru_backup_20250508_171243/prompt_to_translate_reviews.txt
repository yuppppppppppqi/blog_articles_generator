Everything was good from start to finish. The massage therapists are professional and very attentive. One of the things I really appreciated was the ability to customize my experience in advance. Before the session, you fill out a form where you could choose the pressure level and specify which areas to focus on or avoid. It makes the whole experience seamless, without having to explain everything during the session. The spa itself is clean, modern, and beautifully maintained. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing—you start unwinding the moment you step inside. There’s no rush or chaos, just pure tranquility. Highly recommended!	Relaxing vibes and nice service. The staff checked the water temperature and explained everything well. The room is clean and no any insects or bad smell.  The male staff at the front is very helpful to coordinating with the spa owner to extend the voucher expiry date which was bought directly from the spa. Appreciated. 	Very good hidden gem, massage is really good & hard strength. From head to toe. Love the onsen bath & choices of essential oil. Totally a unforgettable relaxing experience in bangkok, will visit again. They do have a off peak discount on the package at 2050baht. For 2.5hrs. 	I recently visited Forest Massage and Spa in Bangkok, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The online booking process was incredibly easy and hassle-free, making it convenient to secure an appointment. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the beautiful and serene environment, which set the tone for a truly relaxing experience.  The therapist I had was not only skilled but also very kind and gentle, making me feel completely at ease. The massage itself was wonderfully soothing, with just the right amount of pressure. Considering the quality of service and the calming atmosphere, the price is truly value for money. I highly recommend Forest Massage and Spa for anyone looking for a rejuvenating experience in Bangkok.	I had a wonderful experience at Forest Massage & Spa Onsen. The massage was very relaxing, and the specialist paid great attention to all the areas that needed care. The atmosphere was calming and professional. My only small remark is that my feet got a bit cold during the session, but it didn’t affect the overall enjoyment. Highly recommend this place for anyone seeking quality care and relaxation. 	Booked online by my fiance, we arrived a bit earlier and could start the entire process  They handed us out a small flyer so that we could show where exactly we wanted the focus to be and how soft/hard.  The onsen was really nice, really warm water and clean, you get all the needed clothes and overall very welcoming and nice setup rooms  The massages were also done well, definitely helped a few bits of my back pain.  Price wise for the location it's more or less okay, maybe a bit on the high end since the neighborhood is overall more expensive than others.  Only thing I wish they would improve:  The explanations, like when does X happen or what should we do at Y etc	Bought a package for couples, onsen + office syndrome massage. Great experience. Will visit again next time :) 	First time trying forest massage as it’s near to hotel am staying. What a gem! Excellent service and most importantly the therapist knows all the hidden spots to release the tension and knot! The place is relaxing and seems relatively new. Easy to reserve via line and prompt in reply. Highly recommended 	Great experience! The staff were all very professional and skilled. The massage was very relaxing, the therapist does not rush you, ensuring that you are enjoying every moment of the experience. I highly recommend! 	Everything was just amazing right from the entrance! That foot bath at the beginning - set the very right mood for the rest of spa time here. And the massage was exactly what I needed! Thank you for your hospitality, will definitely come again! 🥰 … 	Went there yesterday for a 2hr full body aromatherapy oil massage. It was amazing overall.  My therapist was very skilled in massage and was attentive. She let me pick my oil and focused on the areas I requested. At  times the massage was a bit painful, but I felt that is because she was really getting rid of all the knots in my shoulders (which feel fantastic today), but mostly it was super relaxing. Pretty sure I fell asleep.  I have long hair, and they gave me a shower cap to cover it and prevent it getting all oily. However, after a while the elastic bad pressed into my forehead and it hurt enough to distract me from the massage. So, if you are a person with long hair, take a clip or a bobble with you to tie your hair up. 	An exceptional experience from start to finish! The service was highly professional, and the attention to detail was outstanding. This was by far the best Thai massage I’ve had — deeply relaxing yet incredibly effective. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-quality massage experience! 	Super satisfied with the service, cleanliness and convenience of this place to my hotel!  They’re available for booking on LINE and across multiple platforms such as kkday, klook, and the prices are pretty reasonable. There are also promotions which you can find on their facebook or on LINE.  My therapist Mai was really good with her hands. I felt soothed and rejuvenated after my massage. There was also a shower after for aromatherapy massages. 	A very decent place to do a massage. You have to make a booking before coming here. The place is clean and relaxing. It's not like other massage shops along Thonglor which are very crowded and untidy.  I believe they have a good booking system that avoid bunch of people flooding the shop and end up with poor massage quality. 	Relaxing onsen experience with watermelon juice. The price is reasonable and the service is great! 	I booked the A2 spa package for my partner and I, and we were both pleased with our experience with the private onsen and aromatic oil massage. We enjoyed the ambience of the massage parlour, as it was very nature-esque. Would recommend. 	Very calm and lovely place. From the reception to the massage itself, everyone was very professional, kind and welcoming. The place was clean, well designed and obviously well taken care of. I’ll definitely be back soon! 	This is the best spa that I ever had in Bangkok. This spa is better than those luxury brand One. The therapist is really skillful with technique. I am a very high expectation guest , and I am super satisfied with this spa. Will defiantly come back . My therapist is NUCH 	I am absolutely delighted with the service I received and can't wait to recommend it to my friends. 	A perfect escape in the heart of Bangkok. Aromatherapy massage was expertly done - deep, soothing, and left me feeling completely refreshed. The onsen spa was serene and well-maintained, with warm, mineral-rich baths that melted away all tension. A must-visit for relaxation and rejuvenation. 😊❤️ …
