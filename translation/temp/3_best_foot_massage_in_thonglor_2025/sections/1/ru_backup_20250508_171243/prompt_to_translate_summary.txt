The interior design blends beautifully with Thai elements, creating a peaceful and calming energy throughout the space.  I was greeted by the receptionist by name before I even introduced myself—now that’s impressive. Their warm and friendly welcome made me feel well taken care of before the treatment even began.  The welcome drink was fresh and delicious, the perfect refreshment after walking in from the hot sun. Before the treatment started, everything was explained to me in detail, which really put my mind at ease.  I had a facial treatment this time, and three days later… wow. My skin has never felt so radiant, smooth, and glowing.  This place is highly recommended if you’re looking to treat yourself with top-notch service and guaranteed quality. 	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a facial at Loft Thai Spa, Sukhumvit 38 in Bangkok, and it was truly one of the most relaxing and rejuvenating treatments I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was serene and inviting, with refreshing beverages and calming scents setting the perfect mood.  The staff was incredibly professional and attentive, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout the entire session. The facial itself was divine—my skin was thoroughly cleansed, exfoliated, and it was feeling refreshed and glowing. The therapist’s technique was gentle yet effective, and I appreciated the extra care they took to personalize the treatment to my skin type.  I also loved the little details, like the relaxing facial, the complimentary foot massage and the warm tea and snack at the end, which made the experience feel even more luxurious. If anyone in Bangkok and looking for a top-notch spa experience, I highly recommend treating yourself to a facial here. It’s a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.	A huge thank you to the entire team at Loft Thai Spa! My friend and I had an exceptional experience. The welcome was warm, the place was peaceful, and the massages… simply amazing. It was both relaxing and rejuvenating. We left feeling calm and happy. Thank you again for your professionalism and kindness. We’ll definitely be back! 	Totally exquisite experience from start to finish! I felt so relaxed and happy. I am so thankful to everyone who works here 🙏 they helped me choose the treatments for my needs, and the therapist who treated me was wonderful, used the perfect pressure and asked for feedback, made me feel very comfortable and was very professional. I have had a lot of foot massages, as I have chronic pain, and the foot massage here is the best ever. So relaxing. I did not want to leave after treatments! I will definitely return many times before I go home 💜👌☺️ thank you to the lovely ladies in the receptionist and to the therapist, I did not get her name but she is fantastic 😍 	Absolutely fantastic experience! The massage was incredibly relaxing and tailored to my needs, relieving tension in all the right areas. The cupping was expertly done, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. The skin treatment was also top-notch, leaving my skin glowing and refreshed. The therapist was highly skilled, attentive, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire session. I walked out feeling like a new person! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comprehensive and excellent wellness experience. Five stars! 	Found Loft Thai Spa based on highest Google reviews. Some personal background I am a frequent wellness spa junky back home in Kuala Lumpur.  Admittedly nothing beats my personal masseuse who rolls me out knuckles and elbow until I’m mushed. Not for the faint hearted coz it can be painful but all my kinks will disappear after each session.  So since I’m on holiday I wanted a more relax feeling but still firm. This place met my wants and needs and the atmosphere + ambience + service was a bonus.  Love the skylight architecture. We went for the Aesop Facial Spa and Lady Spa Package. After each session we were given a lovely tea pot and bite size local delicacies.  Hip hip hoorah to Roxy for being a wonderful host and patiently entertained all our questions. Will definitely return again❤️ 	I had the best massage of my entire life today!  Me and my friend took very long to decide what kind of massage we want and the receptionist was very patiently waiting and askied if we needed any help.  I have sensitive skin so I asked them to show me the products they use for their facial and they were kind enough to do that.  In the end, I went with 120mins aromatherapy deep tissue oil massage with coconut oil as suggested by them for people with sensitive skin and I left the massage with supple and smooth skin!  The entire massage experience starts with interacting with knowledgeable receptionist about the massages/facial they offer and a refreshing healing butterfly pea tea and hot towel for your hands.  After that, they provide a form for you to write down your massage strength preference, area of focus/avoid. You are then brought to a cozy, dimly lit, room with a private bathroom and outdoor shower for your massage.  The masseuse here clearly has better and more professional technique, it was the right strength to release the tension and knots in my body, I fell asleep briefly because I felt so relaxed during the massage.  You are given shower gel and lotion to shower after if you want to rinse off the oils. The massage experience ends with 3 types of dessert, pandan jelly cake, pumpkin shallots cake and coconut ondeh paired with herbal tea.  Would definitely come back again to treat myself! 	Loft Thai Spa is the must-go spa in Bangkok. You cannot miss this Amazing spa. My family and I visited twice in a week since it's so relaxing and comfortable. Professional massage and service. Big Thank You to Gie and our therapists (Apple and Cherry)! Our sore bodies will miss you all! 🥰😆	Very nice and clean place. We very very good taken care of and the massage was holistic - from feet to body and head. People are extremely nice and good skilled. The only minus is a bit expensive.	My friends and I came here because of all the amazing reviews and the facility looks clean. The staff were amazing, welcoming and accommodating. We got the welcome drink and after treatment snacks and tea, but the facial was mediocre. We paid $4800 baht/person, which is equivalent to $140 usd for the hydra-facial. This is considered pricey for Thailand, so we were expecting our face to be clean and glowing afterwards, it was not. The description on their website for the hydra-facial includes “extraction”, upon arrive we were told no manual extraction, the only “extraction” we were getting is from the suctioning of the hydra-facial machine. The facial “massage” and foot bath felt more like a caress than a massage. My face felt exactly the same after, grimy with black heads and milia. I came back to the hotel and rewashed my face. For the price we paid, we would not go back for mediocre results. I rather pay a little more in America for medical grade hydra-facial where they actually cleanse and extract your pores. 	Had a lovely experience! Went for my first prenatal massage at 16 weeks and the masseuse made sure I was comfortable with sufficient pillows and checked in with me now and then. The massage was comfy with a good amount of pressure! 	It was a great experience. A little pricey but great. Would recommend the half day spa with body scrub, hot stone oil massage and facial 	What an outstanding experience. My husband and I requested the couples indulgence package. It was 3 amazing hours of truly some of the best treatments we have ever received. The esthetics of the spa are tasteful and calming and the service is 5 star quality. Worth the trip. So happy we found them. 	Great place to have a good massage, good facial and a pampering time! The Thai massage was really good and so was the facial. They serve you with a drink before the spa and snacks after. The receptionists speak very good English and reservation can be made easily though WhatsApp as well. Would recommend this place though it’s more expensive than other Thai massage places but you get a great massage that relieves your knots! 	The staffs were great! I went to treat fatigue and soreness… I got to relax and alleviate almost all soreness. Great service and tea!	This spa in Bangkok is truly exceptional! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The masseuses are highly skilled, especially with their pregnancy massage techniques. They even surprised us with a thoughtful gift for our baby, showcasing their commitment to customer care. I wholeheartedly recommend this spa for anyone seeking a top-notch relaxation experience! 	Lovely spa that provides massages and spa treatments with smiles and desserts! On the expensive side but totally worth it if you want to splurge on yourself! 	I had an amazing time with their Thai compress massage program! The complementary snacks and service quality were superb. You can tell after receiving the service that their therapists here are experienced. After the massage, my shoulders and legs pains are gone. I love it. Definitely come back again for their massage💕  Ps. I recommend you book the appointment in advance, so they can prep everything ready to serve you :) 	Roxy and kitty and Iris were increíble!!!  What a truly luxurious experience to have a half of a spa day, they made the whole transition seamless into my time in Thailand. If you are ever in Bangkok, you have to go to the Loft.!	One of the most disappointing massage experiences in Thailand. Not only is the music driving someone crazy but they place didn’t feel welcoming at all. I was left waiting 10 minutes without a drink, didn’t get a foot bath, the room was too bright and hot and the massage was way below the quality I expected. This is not worth the price at all. For a cheap corner shop massage it’s okay but not for this experience  Edit: It is clear now why their reviews are so good. After leaving the original review the place emailed me and offered a refund if I delete my comment. Since I believe in transparency that won’t happen. Clearly this is not the first time and shows that their score should be a lot lower than it currently is.
