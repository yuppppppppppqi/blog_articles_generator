My first visit was a traditional Thai massage and the masseuse was very skillful. My second visit, I did half hour of foot massage & 1-hr Thai massage; the masseuse was very skillful as well. This location was clean and had a calming vibe. It is also close to Thong Lor BTS. I would go back again and recommend it. 	It's a place that many Koreans recommend, but in my personal experience, it wasn't that great. I don't think I'll go there again. 	I recently visited Dala Massage , I was really impressed. The massage was great and helped me relax, feeling very comfortable. However, there was one thing that made the experience feel less than perfect: the massage ended 5 minutes earlier than the promised time. Although it's a small detail, it did leave me a bit dissatisfied. If the shop could improve on being more punctual, it would be even better. But overall, it was still a good experience and I would consider returning. 	Enjoyed a Good foot massage there, price reasonable and it’s a nice clean cosy place as well	If you are looking for a reputable massage shop with qualified therapists, this is the right place for you. I had a 90 Minute Massage and the therapist was Mali. She immediately identified the area of ​​my back where the problems were. I went back the next day and she treated it with a special balm. I can realy recommend Dala Massage and will come back several times. The Best massage Shop i ever visited in Bangkok. 	I‘m back in Bangkok and visited Dala Massage immediately after landing. I had extreme neck pain and after several visits to the therapist Noi Na, it has now completely disappeared. Thank you for the excellent therapy. I will always come back when I’m in Bangkok. Best wishes. Olaf	Good place for those who like hard massages. The masseuse really kneaded every muscle and knot on my body and gave a good stretch. Too hard for me but it will be perfect for anyone who needs a sport massage. Clean and professional setting. 	Had a great foot massage here. Not too hard but good technique, nice and relaxing.  Only negative was a group of noisy Chinese tourists talking quite loudly in the beginning. Would be nice if the staff could point out to people if needed to keep the noise down, as it can ruin the experience for others.  Also there should not be any need for pre-tip. If the massage is good then they'll get a tip anyway, along with repeat business. By mandating a tip for booked appointments you are hurting your business as most people will look elsewhere. I've been coming to Thailand for over 10 years and have never come across this. Just saying....	Proper Thai massages at very reasonable prices. We were a group of 5 without a booking and got seen to immediately. Just be aware that typical Thai massages are quite firm! 	I love love love DALA! I have come to Thailand many times and I always go back to Dala because I know I will have excellent treatment! Always great customer service, cleanliness and friendliness. If you’re staying in ThongLor then I would suggest you check them out! ☺️ 	The service is very good and the chef is very attentive. I will come again next time. 	Not super professional therapists and massage room is to small . Staff speaking very loud with each others and dosnt shy of clients. My therapist was NO SKILL AT ALL and looks tired of life … Massage salon doesn’t looks clean . I think I waste my time . Tiger massage on same street much better 	Good place… nice technique and very relaxing 	At first, you’ll notice how cramped the place feels, packed with customers and with little room to spare. The massage bed takes up almost all the space in your private cubicle, leaving just enough room to settle in. But once the Thai massage begins, all those initial concerns disappear. The masseuse’s technique is vigorous, professional, and incredibly effective.  Despite the crowded environment, the experience is truly delightful. I won’t reveal the name of my masseuse because I want to keep her to myself, but she definitely deserves a medal	I’ve been to Dala 20+ times and it’s always high quality massages, nice girls, clean and chilled environment, strongly recommend ❤️  I find 90 minutes thai massage + foot massage the best pampering experience  Remember to tip the therapist though cause prices are on a low side despite the great conditions and perfect service	Super recommend if u need more relaxing!! 	We had a full family foot/Thai massage here and it was lovely. The staff are so attentive Massage was excellent mix of pressure and stretching. Lighting was very dim with relaxed music in the background We couldn’t all be seated at the same time but the manager/owner made space for us in a short time. So grateful	One of the best massages that we have ever had so far! The price is right, but most importantly, the massages were right on point! The masseurs were very strong and powerful, so they could really touch  all the deep tissues and release the tension in your muscles! Both my husband and I were very happy with the quality that we came back for a second time! Highly recommend to everyone who stays nearby! 	The first one has no mood to service me because she forgot to arrange me change clothes and she kept looking outside of window while she massaging, most importantly she only gently touched my feet. I complaint her and the manager changed another for me, the second one is much better than first one. Honestly, the manager and boss both have very good attitude to settle down my complaint, but the quality of massage is not good as their attitude. 	Walked into the first shop I saw on a Friday afternoon and my 60 minute foot massage was amazing! The first 45 minutes were foot/leg massage and the last 10 minutes were a neck/shoulder/back massage. My masseuse was Mon and she was so strong! The atmosphere was really nice. The lights were dim and it was quiet with relaxing music playing in the background. Really enjoyed it here, thank you!
