Masseuses are quite skillful. PS. If you buy a package deal, you save about 10% (I did.) 	Overall, a good experience.  Told my masseuse (with the help of my wife) to go easy on me with a neck and shoulder massage and she did quite well.  Probably one of the few massages I’ve ever gotten where the service lasted the entire hour. My only gripe is the outside noise from the traffic (I know, there’s not much they can do), and my masseuse had a couple words with the other masseuse next door during my massage.  She was very kind beyond that. 	Good massage. Masseuse actually responded when I asked for more pressure.  A bit pricey for the area, 400 baht 1 hour heand and neck massage.  Facilities are clean.  There was an off duty masseuse in the next space who was texting texting texting with super loud notifications on. Super annoying.	Good professional massage. They have shower available, they provide pants for patrons, they provide tea, all that small things. Apparently locals go there too (overheard one talking on the phone next to me) Positive Professionalism	Recommend to get a foot massage by Khun Mam. She is a part-time masseuse but very good. You can book for her on the weekends. 	Very good service and relaxing massage. The ladies know well about the massage techniques. Thanks a lot for a wonderful Thai massage. 	Authentic Thai massage with soothing and relaxing environment! A good place for you to relax your soul for couple of hours ! 	The place to be! Always a highlight for me to relax. 	The lady was doing her job just horrible, painful and uncomfortable I hated it and just left. But my friend was ok. 	Very nice real thai massage, nice place expert staff affordable price, athrapist name miss wa is very expert and professional. 	Always have a good experience here. Quality massages and very professional. 	Best massage on the area by far! 	“Massage is good to the strands. The massage was very satisfying.” Before going, it is recommended to make a reservation and inform us what type of massage you want: light/heavy. Each person's experience is different. The doctor I booked and massaged today requested a 2 hour intensive massage. Royal style, thumb press, strong and precise lines. When stepping on the legs, it was hard at the point, didn't hit the bones, and the force was stable for 2 hours. Bael fruit juice is delicious. I've studied massage and only when the doctor holds the first line will I know if I'm good at massaging or not. I'll stop by and go back for another massage. The price is suitable for the quality.	Bad massage, focusing on force, not hitting the tendons, massaging the neck, shoulders, the doctor told me to lie face down for 1 hour, did not change positions until my arm hurt. When I moved my arm because it hurt, he pushed it back to the original position with his hand and complained not to be afraid. When I told him that my arm hurt, he said that he was afraid himself, it must hurt anyway. Does the doctor really not know if the muscles are afraid or tense? I like massages a lot, but I have never met any shop that massages with force. In the end, when I got home, my neck was still tense, and my arm hurt too.  Some people are lucky to get a good doctor, but my girlfriend was unlucky. They should maintain the standard because the price is not cheap.  I want to give 0 stars but I didn't.  What a waste of money. A massage for 2 people costs 1,500 baht. It's not worth it. The name should be changed to Feel Bad Thai massage.  If you want to come to this shop, I recommend getting a massage at a coin-operated massage chair instead. 	The price is reasonable, they are friendly, and the massage is good. I recommend it as the parking facility is also good!!	The first massage was very good. The second time I got a massage, I didn't really hit the right spot, and the staff gossiped about customers who just left the shop... 	It's been a while since I've gone to get a massage, but here all the masseuses are very skilled. 	Good massage, but the area may be a little small. Minus 1 star because the masseuse likes to talk to each other often. 	I personally like it. Good massage, strong but not painful. The shop is clean, fragrant, quiet, good service, polite. There is a zone divided into massage rooms. clear foot massage	Clean, good masseuse, 2 hours worth the price.
