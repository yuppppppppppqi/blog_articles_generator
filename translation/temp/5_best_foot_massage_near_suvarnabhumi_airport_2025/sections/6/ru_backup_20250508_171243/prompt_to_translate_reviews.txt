Spend 1 hrs for Thai Massage and I would say above average.  Price is Reasonable and staff is friendly. Masseur skills is good too. If happened to be around the area, would come back again. 	Been in Thailand over 10 years. 100's massages. This shop was such a great find. P Earn is super talented. Very professional and friendly with a big 😁. She knows the body very well. Expect some pain in order to release the tension. Room was comfortable, not too cold and pleasant music. Highly recommend!! … 	I don't usually go for massages, but I have been feeling a lot of ache and pain in my shoulder muscle, so I decided to get a shoulder massage. I found this massage spa on Google Maps. After one hour of head, neck, and shoulder massage, I felt relieved of all the pain and muscle ache. The masseuse was professional and caring. A good massage place to visit around Udom Suk. 	The massage therapist is truly a skilled professional! It was very relaxing and comfortable. I love it! 	It was the least satisfying two-hour massage I've ever had. The shop has no sound isolation, so you constantly hear cars, motorcycles, and outside noise, making relaxation impossible. The massage itself was dull and unsatisfying—I just lay there waiting for it to end. To top it off, I paid for two hours but only received 1 hour and 45 minutes. 	If you like waiting and end up not getting a massage come here. When we first booked our spot, the massage place said we had to wait around 40 minutes and confirmed our reservation. We went for dinner and returned 5 minutes early. The receptionist made us wait 15 minutes, before telling us it would take another 5 minutes for their staff to arrive. Once that 5 minutes passed, she told us that we would need to wait another 40 minutes because those staff had other customers that were more important than us. They clearly us differently because we were foreigners, and not as important as their local customers. 	Highly Recommended for people who wants to pamper their body and mind. very relaxing and affordable Spa. Keep it up! 	Very good massage! We dropped by completely spontaneously and we received an excellent treatment. People were friendly and they take credit card.  So big advantage here.  Greetings to the lady with the strong elbows!	Very bad experience. The masseur was very rude and kept interrupting my conversation with my friend. The masseur kept chatting during the process. During the massage, we kept asking the masseur to increase the intensity, but we did not get a response. The massage skills were poor. From the beginning to the end, I just felt as if the masseuse was just touching my body without pressing. It is very scary to let guests of the opposite sex directly enter the cubicle while naked, and the curtains cannot be completely closed. 	Had a good experience twice as someone not from thailand! Their massage is so nice! Staffs are very caring and friendly! 	Super good massage please and the massager is really professional. Good price and I have tried set B which 90mins spa in 990 baht which includes milk and body scrubs. 	Very happy with the massage , really relaxing. The staff is very highly experienced and good at their job. 	I did the medication one and I great experience, great service. The place is nice and clean. 	I did body and face massge while i reallt needed. Really relaxing and superb love the massage therpaist lady who did my face very well location is not so far as welll💓💯 …	One of the best place to massage in bangkok thailand. You will feel pleasurable welcome and feel good massage. Try once when you are here in thailand. Don’t Miss !  Thank You Roma Massage & Spa 	The massage by crazy felt totally professional I was comfortable at all time. 	Amazing massage. They have loyalty cards so I will definitely come back until I can get my free massage ✨👍 … 	Really enjoyable for a good massage. Been visiting for over a year when im in Bangkok. Highly recommend a visit when you are staying in the area! 	Found this gem of a place walking past the shop. I had the best massage had in a while. Also had a facial massage and cleanse, which was as good. I highly recommend Roma Massage Spa for anyone looking for good massage and a lovely clean space with amazing polite staff. Thank you ladies. 	Great place to have a massage in Thailand!! We had Thai Massage for 1 hr and the staffs were very professional and polite
