Owner was very kind and staff were really good at what they were doing. I would highly recommend this place which you can find once you step out of Udomsuk BTS. It was a repeat visit for me as the foot & Head , shoulder and back massage was very much relaxing. Totally worth a visit. 	Highly recommend this shop for your foot massage. I’ve tried some places but this shop is the best, they know how to relax your muscles and release pains 	I rang ahead and booked an appointment for 2x foot massages. When we arrived, the man behind the desk said I “cannot have a foot massage, I will not fit in the chair” because I “am big”. He went on to say if I sit in his chair, “the chair will be broken.” Good people of google, I do have a big butt. But given I have never broken a chair in my life, buy all my clothes at a regular store and could have easily fit in the chair I think these comments were unwarranted. TWO female Thai massage staff apologised to me on behalf of the boss; they were clearly embarrassed. I was with my 8 year old son so I ended up getting an oil massage which was excellent so the stars are purely for the rude boss. Photo of my butt for reference 	My back has been in a lot of pain, sleeping, and everyday movements have been painful. I went to this massage parlour, and I'm so glad I chose this one. I've had many massages in bangkok. This has to be one of, if not the best I've had. Sometimes I ask for something, and i don't get it. Here, she took the time to focus on my problem areas and skipped the ares that needed less attention. This meant I got much better value for my hour. My therapist was called Moxie or something similar. I believe that she was only 21. I usually go for old therapists because I think they have more experience, well she's proven me wrong. I'm so impressed. I will be living in bangkok, so I will make sure I return many times. I was served tea at the end, which tasted lovely. Also, you know it's professional when they wash your feet first and give you clothing to put on. Many places do this, but some do not. If you keep the clothes on that you entered with, expect a less professional massage. 	I have extensive experience with massages, and I can confidently say that “Na Siam Massage” is the best massage parlor in Bangkok. I lived in the city for almost a year and visited this salon nearly every day. The prices are very reasonable, and the selection of masseuses is impressive. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, and their professional skills are top-notch. The salon operates on a queue system, but you always have the option to choose your own masseuse. I usually booked my sessions in advance, although it probably wasn’t necessary since there was always a free masseuse available. Throughout my visits, I encountered both seasoned professionals and newcomers to the trade, and each session was enjoyable in its own way. The boss is a true heart of the establishment, always greeting with a smile. However, the real star of the salon is Dr. Ton. I met him at another salon and always chose him for my massages. When he moved to “Na Siam Massage,” I followed, and I have no regrets. Besides massages, I also tried the body scrub, and it was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend this salon to everyone. When I’m back in Bangkok, this will be the first place I visit. 	Very bad. I rarely criticise massage service and this is my first time rating a thai massage. Speechless.  I need to go back to p's thai massage or thanomchaiaree massage for the best experience 	First time was quite okay , but my second visit I decided to go for 2 hours and I not just ended up paying more than agreed in the beginning, but also with a way too painful massage. I couldn’t relax once within 2 hours and told the lady more than 5 times to be softer. She seemed to understand but would always go back to it. Left the place in pain and turning my head to even look somewhere is painful. I rarely write reviews because massages are great everywhere in Thailand, but id warn someone out there one unless you like it harder than the Thai average. 	Went twice in a week.  I had neck back massage for 300 baht.  Asked for a guy and he pressed very hard, will go again. 	I have been here more than 5 times. Only first time was fine . And rest of times, I was hesitant to give tips as did't satisfied. Most of young massager should have better skill more. 	Love it, this is the first foot massage place in Thailand that focus on the foot. I love it, I did not get the name of the young lady but, she was wonderful, thank you. I would go back here every day 	I went here because of the high rating but was not impressed. It was one of the most painful experiences that I went through, getting a head and shoulder massage. Some people may be into the deep, painful massage but it left me very stiff and I could feel my upper back was swollen for the next couple of days.  I ended up going over to So Relax Massage on the other side of the BTS Station for the remainder of my massages. They were much more in tune with my individual preference of the type of massage I like. 	decent skill, communication and price. popular among locals. independent room provided for full body massage. strong woman massage personnel available. Ask for the full body oil massage not only foot, the service definitely worths the price! 	Was really looking forward to this place because of all the five star reviews. Unfortunately I got the worst foot massage and I ended up canceling the other massage I was going to do. It really depends on who you get as a masseuse I suppose because the girl assigned to me seemed very inexperienced and I felt like I just paid to have her touch my feet not give a massage. The two other people giving a massage next to me seemed better at their jobs. I tried to communicate via Google translate but there's really not much you can say when the problem is lack of experience. I told the guy at the desk I was disappointed by the massage and he said sorry but was completely unfazed. Perhaps it's because I'm a foreigner so he didn't care? It was seriously a waste of money. I think there are much better places with better customer service at the same price. 	Was really looking forward to this place because of all the five star reviews.

I like the massage hard, and the masseur provided it with his strong fingers and elbows. My scapulas were full of knots and he did a very good job. He used some menthol ointment (like Bengay) that also warms up the muscles. After the massage they served a cup of warm tea. Definitely would visit here again. It is a clean place. But let me warn you, if you don't like the hard stuff just go with the classic mild Thai massage. By the way, I paid 300 baht for an hour of massage which is a very good deal (I also tipped the masseur).	Probably the best foot massage I've gotten in Bangkok and you can't beat the price. I was served by this older lady and she knew what she's doing and hit all the right spots. Definitely will return the next time I'm there. 	Excellent foot massage for 200 baht in a friendly and clean environment. The fiancée got the Thai massage (also 200 baht) and loved it, even though it was one of the most firm ones she's had. Great service and value, plus steps from Udom Suk BTS! 	I used to go there sometimes because I live nearby, but I don't anymore. There is a big difference in the skill of the staff. The bad staef is that they cut corners. 	I visited here several times during my stay in Bangkok in Dec '16 because I stayed at a condo nearby and again in March/April '17.  I received excellent service each time and I highly recommend anyone who likes to get a professional Thai massage to visit Na Siam. 	Good massage in town  near BTS. Udomsuk exit 4.
