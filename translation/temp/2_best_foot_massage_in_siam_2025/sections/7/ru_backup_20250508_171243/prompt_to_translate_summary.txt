The moment I stepped in, I was greeted with a relaxing scent and calming music. The staff were so friendly and welcoming!  I chose the 30-minute foot massage package and honestly, it felt like I was walking on clouds afterward. Pure heaven! If you feel as relaxed and happy as I did, I highly recommend tipping the staff—they really put their heart into the service.  Highly recommend if you need a little escape and recharge during your trip!	Great location next to Siam BTS. Staff were friendly; place was quiet and clean. The massage was on point and I fell asleep during the massage.  Free small bottles of water are available. You would receive a cup of tea and some little sweet snacks after the massage. 	Had such a great experience with the measure Vee and the staff over there. Massage was so good, relax and right point. Moreover, I forgot my ring and they tried to call me to give it back. Highly recommend 	Went for their 1hr foot massage (400baht) and it was really good value for money.  Payment is upfront and they take you upstairs to a quiet room with a comfortable reclining couch. Staff appear technically skilled with the right amount of force applied.  They serve you hot tea at the end with tiny cookies. Would consider returning even if for an impromptu visit. 	The massage itself was great - but the intense noise of the streets cancels out the relaxing music and therefore the atmosphere altogether.  We added a manicure, that - to be completely honest - was disappointing . Once again not the service (the staff are friendly and do take care of you) but the results.	Went for Thai massage with 3 other friends, and another did shoulders massage (she felt it was okay, not bad). Our Thai massage was not bad too, however felt that the masseuses were a bit too chatty among themselves. They seemed to be also laughing in front of us and talking in Thai that we gave too little tips. 	U need to emphasize if u want deep (harder) massage. They can do well if they want to so that’s why I’m not giving it all 5 stars. I believe must use heart in all customers. Priced slightly higher than those on the same row. But overall the environment is clean n pretty new. Nice having salt scrub before Thai massage. So maybe try my luck w another masseur next time haha.. 	Always go to Lek massage at Phrom Phong and never had a bad experience there, though this branch at BTS Siam was horrible. Went with a friend so they put us in one room, masseuses were always talking between each other and rushing through massage like they were rather doing us a favour and not doing the job we paid for. Also, we asked for jasmin oil but they used another. In general the impression was super unpleasant 	I visited the bts siam lek Massage branch with my wife .. Body scrub and aroma oil massage was good for both of us . We asked for head massage in addition to the prebooked body massage. But head massage was horrible for both of us and they charged 200 baht each. 	Wasn't pleased with the massage itself and was way too overpriced for service received. Clean and modern facilities however. 	I had an office syndrome massage for 1 hour and as soon as the therapist started it I regretted it.  The technique was soooo bad. It's like you ask a family member to massage you and they just randomly start pressing on your shoulder, neck, head area without any order and technique. And it's considered too expensive just for this.  The only decent thing was the place. It's clean and they change the face cover.	Used to come here all the time at Siam branch whenever I am in BKK and the standard have dropped a lot esp since they renovated. An old customer from 15years ago, I think it is time I find another place for massage. Girl at the reception was rude and unwelcoming, made a funny face and made some comments in Thai . Lady who massage my foot seem to be only rubbing oil on my legs. Think any child could do the same! My hubby also had a bad back after while the guy who massaged him tried to force a stretch and cracked his back. 16/4/24 	What I like about Lek Siam:  😎 No mandatory booking required, handy to go to a quick massage after shopping nearby  😎 Reasonable pricing. Download app and you can enjoy different level of discount  😎 Responsive, patient and friendly reception desk to guide first time customer  😎 Therapist K. Nok is very experienced and friendly. I tried her Head and Shoulder massage for 1 hour, and it's a great cure to my office syndrome 😇	place is nice and clean. really liked the upstairs room they took me to for the foot massage. i did a 30 min foot massage for 350 baht. massage was not that good because she just rubbed oil on my legs for the most part. not much technique used. this was my first thai massage. my boyfriend can massage my feet better than this. however the atmosphere and vibe was very relaxing and staff members were decent.	K done my eyelashes. He was very professional and attractive. He paid attention to detail. I was happy with the result. Yes the place is more expensive then others but as a personal choice was good decision. 	Worse massage ever. Paid for one hour but walked out after 30 minutes. Asked for refund but was denied. Wast of 400 baht. 	Reception was playing a video game and more interested in the game rather than helping. Massage felt very rushed, with quick and inconsistent movements. 	The masseuse I was assigned was good! Had a good foot, head and shoulder massage at this place! Love it! 	This place seems to only welcome foreigners. It's sad to see that when it comes to fellow countrymen, they cannot be bothered, even though we paid the same price. The masseur kept looking at the clock as if he couldn't wait for the hour to end. Forget about the quality; at times, it was too soft. When you ask for it to be a little harder, they almost break your bones. Overall, the service is poor, rude recipients, and the massage quality is subpar. It may be convenient for foreigners staying around here, but nothing else is good. Certainly not going to return or recommend	Amazing place all in one for excellent massage and to get nails done. I had the most amazing Gel nail polish done along with the manicure. I was super impressed. All the people are really hard working and go for perfection! Highly recommend if you are in the neighbourhood. I left with baby feet.
