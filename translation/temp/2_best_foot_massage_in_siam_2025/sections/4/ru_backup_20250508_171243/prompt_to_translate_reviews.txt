Although not the cheapest I’ve seen in Bangkok, this is right outside the Icon Siam mall which makes it very reasonably priced if you want other options besides the massage places inside the mall. My masseuse was great and put appropriate pressure on the stiff places on my back. I would recommend to anyone. Even a complimentary cup of green tea when you are finished. 	My favorite place in this area for a foot massage (finishing with neck and shoulders). When I was in Bangkok 2 1/2 years ago and quite pregnant, I came every day. I came back in today and it was still great! Efficient but effective, smells good, clean, comfortable chairs. I prefer the casual massage shop experience over a fancy spa for a foot/leg massage, so if you like that too, give this one a try. 	Very clean and comfy! definitely a place to return! and good massage which I'm not a person who like massage. just next to iconsiam (turn left when u exit from siam street food floor) within 1min walk 	The overall atmosphere of the massage parlor was rather ordinary. When I checked their price list, the front desk service felt unwelcoming, especially compared to other establishments in Thailand known for their hospitality. I was also uncomfortable with their policy of requiring payment upfront before the service. This can make it difficult for customers to address any dissatisfaction with the service. The therapist was eager to meet my expectations and repeatedly checked in to ensure the pressure was satisfactory. However, despite her efforts, the pressure was not sufficient. For those seeking a strong foot massage, consider this when choosing your therapist. 	Clean and relax place for massage. Staffs are all so friendly. Reasonable price, 650baht for Foot + Oil massage, the masseuse is attentive with skills. she speaks softly, but does not understand Eng very well.	Very good relax massage, thank you 🙏🏻 Lucky and happy are very cute ❤️ … 	Great massage! Better than the rest we’ve tried. The lady on the right, which I forgot to ask her name, is really good. Btw there’s a really cute white cat in the shop too! Will definitely come again on our next visit to Bangkok! 	Lovely massage and customer service! We popped in without any kind of booking and they immediately accommodated us with a smile. We opted for 90 minute aromatherapy massage and were shown to a private couples room complete with  shower facilities. The massage was so relaxing and attentive. Therapists so professional and kind. After we paid and left my wife realized she had misplaced her necklace but they were quick to find and return it! 	Nice massage spa nearby the huge shopping mall. Good prices being in Bangkok riverside area. Cleanliness and professional staff. Look for the white furry sleeping cat!	When your staying near Icon Siam Mall and want to get an authentic thai massage you should try this place. Me and my wife came back for a second time.  Place is clean and staffs are friendly and massage therapist are expert in providing an authentic thai massage 	🙀Omg our trip in thailand oct 2023 around 1 week. We been doing massage for 4 places including pattaya, floating market and bkk.  😳Turned out, we found this one to be the best!! 9/10/2023 P Pu and P nut really are expert!! They really did make us feel so impressive and relief from pain. It really a very good thai traditional massage. 2 of us get a very good massage and 2 hrs only 550 thb. We really recommend and appreciated their time, kindness and expertise.  ⏰Only 5 mins walk from Iconsiam  🙏🏻Thank you! And to the shop owner! P Pu พี่ปู and P Nut พี่นัท really make us want to come back again!  ✅Totally worth it 😍🥰 10/10	Me and my husband came to do it and they finished the massage 15 min before the right time an didn’t care when we said. Very very disappointing 	Feet, neck and head. 60min. - Location. We looked for one after leaving IconSiam. The street is full of massage places so we went in in the first one that looked ok. (4.2 Google reviews.) - Facilities. Clean and tidy. - Massage. Feet: At times ok, at times not enough pressure. Had to tell her to do it stronger. Neck. She stood up on a bench behind me and put pressure on my shoulders with her whole body weight. It wasn't good. 20 minutes after finishing i started to have back pain due to supporting her weight in a bad position. Head: did not feel comfortable. Also nails were a bit long.  Summary: They have many masseuse in the store, so i was unlucky and got one with less skills. I would not recommend it based on my one time experience. And i can understand now why there are so many 5 stars and a decent proportion of 1 star reviews. 	Very relaxing. Quiet environment with plush chairs. I got a foot, neck, head massage for 300 baht and the pressure and technique of the masseuse was great. 	Very bad experience For the person in charge(a young lady) already showed black face to us when we are deciding which massage to do  May be because of song kran festival? The massage staff said already do 7 customer today, very tired  And she demonstrated a very rude manner, even throw the towel to my body… seems like I done something wrong to her, depriving her rest hour I guess? And the skills is bad as well  Definitely won’t come again… the worst experience ever in Thailand 	Very affordable and great masseuses. Other places in Bangkok are more expensive and not as good. I would rather travel to here than spend more elsewhere 	After we shopping in Icon siam we go to do massage thai with blma they are good massage we recommend this shop Cute 	It’s the best experience in Bangkok! And there’s a cute cat! 	Avoid Avoid… when they were giving the massage it was weak and they didn’t put their heart into the massage. after finishing the massage their hand was at the door getting ready for us to leave. the worst massage i’ve ever experienced. really disappointing…. 	Neck and Foot massage was great. Can recommend
