The foot massage was incredibly relaxing, done in a comfortable armchair with a direct view of the beach. The full-body massage took place in a serene room with a large window overlooking the sea, adding to the tranquil atmosphere.  The room even had a shower, which was a thoughtful touch, and the massage beds were equipped with face holes for added comfort. The therapists were highly skilled, applying just the right amount of pressure in all the right spots—perfectly balancing effectiveness with relaxation.  A truly outstanding experience, both soothing and rejuvenating. Highly recommended. 	Premium feeling with ambient surroundings. Staffs are all with smart uniform. Pricing quite reasonable 1.5hour foot massage cost 600b 	Well i am person who really like being massaged but this is NOT my place for sure. Taking one of most expensive massages by 4 hands oil massage for 1200bat means you expect to be well maintend by someone who knows what to do... Belive me dont do that mistake. We spoke with the frond door woman for two women and I received one man and one woman so far so good i am for the massage maybe those are good ones. Terrible story man i thought i am on muai thai with only elbows then in a hurry not to miss the ferry... Wait the minite you have whole hour... No no i will stop. It is up to you, just to let you know. 	Visiting a Thai massage salon on the island of Samui is like stepping into paradise! Picture this: palm trees swaying gently outside, the soothing sound of waves in the distance, and inside the salon, a serene atmosphere that feels like pure bliss. Everything here exudes the magic of Thailand, from the warm smiles of the staff to every skilled movement of the therapist.  The massage itself? Absolutely transformative. It felt like the therapist wasn’t just working on my muscles but truly understanding what my body needed. Every stretch, press, and touch brought renewed energy and relief. By the end, I felt like a completely recharged version of myself—relaxed, refreshed, and utterly at peace.  Samui has many treasures, but this salon is a true gem. If you’re seeking ultimate relaxation on this dreamlike island, don’t miss out. It’s an experience that reminds you why Samui is not just a destination but a place to reconnect with your mind and body. 	I wanted a Thai Massage with Tiger Balm and paid for it , but the guy didnt even usw it and couldnt even massage me in a proper way. I had a lot of massages but this one was the worst. We were 10 people and nearly all of us were disappointed. 	I’m so sad I could only go here once before heading back home. The relax package was unreal, the lovely lady who looked after me was amazing. There were a couple of spots where I was very very tight and she checked to see if I was alright once she found them. She worked more of the particularly tight parts which was amazing, parts I didn’t think were tight she found and helped relieve them. If only I was staying here for longer I would be there everyday if I could. The price for the service was unbelievable. If you’re on the fence about whether or not to treat yourself to a massage, don’t think, do and go here! 	Worst massage ever! We booked the 2-hour Urban Dream treatment for 1,500 Baht each, expecting a high-level experience. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. Our therapists were very bad, painful and not nice at all. That didn’t agree even to turn off the air conditioning even though I was freezing. They were acting like they were doing me a favor for giving us the massage, and seemed unprofessional. We left feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied. 	Very nice and clean place. Everyone was professional.My Masso wasn’t as great as I would like it but she was very nice. If you are picky like me, make sure to mention before you get your massage done. I’m about to get another massage again. 🤪 … 	Don't waste your time and money. The salon looks good, but it all ends there. My husband gave himself a 4-hand massage, which was terrible. The man who gave him the massage was rude and uncoordinated. No coordination between the four hands. During the massage, he said that he was very rude and careless, but there was no reaction. On leaving the studio, we also shared that the experience was terrible, but there was no reaction. I do not recommend. I did a relaxing massage, which was good. Our whole experience was bad. 	Omg best deep tissue massage ever. Wood was amazing! Had really bad back pain and tightness. After this massage I feel so much better and relaxed. We were looking for a good massage for an ages and finally find this one which was 10/10. Anyone with serious muscle aches I recommend you ask for wood or any of the male staff as they have more strength which was great! 	The best massage in the town, I had massage everyday at different places till I found Urban thai and I can clearly see they are so much better than others- the ambience, massage and professionalism is 10/10 	clean enviroment n friemdly staff not very strong oil quality is good	My partner and I did a massage together. It was my first Thai full body massage. I now have a much fonder regard for coconut oil!  Thank you so very much much for a wonderful experience. The ambiance and care was amazing for a first timer. 	I had one of the best massages ever! The masseuses were incredibly skilled and left me feeling completely relaxed. We opted for the Urban Relax package, and it was a fantastic choice. The couples’ massage room was beautifully appointed and felt so inviting throughout the entire experience. They did ask if I was comfortable with a male masseuse at the beginning, which was incredibly thoughtful. I ended up saying yes, and the overall experience was amazing.	i have never had a massage before but this was actually incredible. i got a back, neck, and shoulder massage which also included my head 😻 my masseuse paid specific attention to my knots and really provided me a lot of relief. thank you so much!! … 	This is the best neck, shoulder, back and head massage I’ve ever had! The name of masseuse was Bella! She was so good! I really recommend this place. And it only kost 430Baht for 60min🥰 … 	Super relaxing experience, Tao was great with the foot and leg massage, with the perfect pressure. I was extremely relaxed and was made to feel super comfortable, also got a shoulder and neck massage at the end big thank you! Would definitely recommend ✨✨✨✨✨ 	This is the best neck, shoulder, back and head massage I’ve had. Toa was my masseuse. He was very good! It’s a nice place and it only costs 429 baht for 60 minutes massage. 	if you have to have a massage in ko samui chaweng, this is the salon you have to go to! and for my part the best masseur is this one, I don't know his name but he is tattooed on his face above the eye. I had 3 massages the last week of March 2025 and the first 2 were with him, and I who am not a fan of massages in general I was very calm with him. I recommend him to you! the 3rd time he was not available I had another man but ... less pleasant because too strong and even if you can ask not too strong, it was not at all the same! too bad .. but long live the next vacation in samui to do other massages but with my masseur otherwise nothing 😂👍 	Warm welcome. Very clean and well-maintained facility with comfortable chairs and massage tables. Excellent staff. There’s only one male massage therapist, Sakorm. If you’re looking for excellent pressure and great technique, this is your guy! Strong and deep pressure if you want. I came in feeling pretty knotty and stiff, and left feeling wonderful. Came with a friend and we’ve been back a few times.
