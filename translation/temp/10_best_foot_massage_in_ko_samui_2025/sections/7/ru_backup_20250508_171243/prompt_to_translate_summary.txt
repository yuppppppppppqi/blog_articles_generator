We did several different ones here - deep tissue foot massage, head/back/neck/shoulders, after sun aloe vera treatment and massage. They have 1hr, 1.5hr and 2hr. The massage is so good - strong but you can ask for less pressure. We came back several times too :) highly recommend 	Me and my wife came here a few times. Very lovely kind staff who took care of us. I saw Big 3 times because the first time he did a great job. One of the best massages I have ever had. Very professional. Big remembered me and what I needed and he took great care of me each time I came back. I feel much better after my few sessions. My wife also saw a couple of ladies who were both great. Thank you! 	Kitty and I, along with a group of friends, decided to treat ourselves to a foot massage at Urban Thai Massage after a delicious dinner.  We had noticed it earlier during our walk back to the hotel and decided to come back.  We both opted for the hot stone massage, which was perfect after a few days of rain in Hatyai and Koh Samui. Kitty loved the hot stones as they helped to release some of the muscle aches and moisture from our bodies.  The massage itself was fantastic, and the hot stones felt very comforting. The staff were professional and skilled, and we were lucky enough to be attended to by two older aunties who had lots of experience. The atmosphere of the massage place was modern and cozy, and the prices were reasonable.  While we enjoyed the experience overall, there were a couple of small things that could have been improved. It would have been nice if they offered hot ginger tea before or after the massage.  We found it a little lacking not to have a warm beverage to relax with. 	I normally don’t give review often but I really have to appreciate this massage. It was SO good! If you have a chance, ask for „Jib“, she was the nicest, most polite and comfortable lady.Also her massage was perfect. She found all the right spots, I didn’t even know were sore and tense and massaged it perfectly. definitely a Thai massage, but also definitely  durable! So highly recommend 	The worst massage ever. What a shame especially in Thailand. I can get a way better massage from my elderly mum. The lady who served me was either lazy or had 0 power to do the massage. What a waste of money to receive just putting some balm for 50 minutes on my feet with a repetitive movement and no real massage. On top of that the AC was too much. I got super cold despite they covered me with 3 towels! I got out from there with a sore throat. The atmosphere was unpleasant. Basically this place is so big, there is no real relaxation. People talking, passing behind you etc. The massage took less time that I paid for. It ended around 10 mins earlier and I was given a small bottle of water, no tea to warm me up after spending 50 mins in this cold place. Don’t make a mistake going there, better choose a small and more intimate place. 	Very highly recommended. I had a 4 hand deep tiger balm massage. This was  not on the menu but there was no problem arranging this. I got handled by 2 guys which with were laughing with me because it was a real deep deep massage 😁 My wife meanwhile enjoyed her oil therapy massage and was also very pleased. … 	Ask For Leena, Give good Tip she very hard worker, she fixed my back and my Sciatic Pain and Severe shoulder pain, I feel so Good now, Best Massage in the World, Trumps all Aussie Massage Therapists. Strong… Also There are fabulous Couples massage Rooms and a nice shower if your hot and sweety before the Massage… Good Air Con and Professional 	Joy was … a joy! Wonderful hot stones massage with oil and so much love! I feel revived and can’t wait to come back 🥰 … 	Unforgettable experience! Strong professionalism and great service. They wash your feet before the session, give you disposable pants, and clean towels. The man named M was fantastic. I made the 60-minute massage at 9 pm, and the room was impeccably clean. 	This place offers amazing massages and exceptional service! The manager, Nuch♥️, speaks excellent English and welcomes you with a warm smile. She takes the time to recommend the perfect treatment for your needs, ensuring a high-quality experience. All the therapists are professional, and the environment is clean and well-maintained. On top of that, the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!🙏 	I've been travelling around the world and always had massage whenever i had the chance. I work as a swedish massage therapist myself. I went here with my 2 adult kids, and we had each a 2-hour session with oil and thai massage. I can easily say that I have never, ever experienced such a professional,  sincere magical massage. The experienced humble man at my age (guess 45-55) is what you are really looking for if you want to have the best massage ever. Unfortunately I never caught his name. Best massage ever. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 🙏❤️ 	This place is amazing! So calming and the staff are kind and very gentle. We had a great time and if we could, we would definitely have stayed for more than two treatments in a row. Definitely recommend you to try at least one time here 	Perhaps the best massage I've ever had. I was massaged by an older masseuse and she single-mindedly found every area that was causing problems, shoulders are still easy, but she even worked on my wrist, which always hurts. The massages here are much more expensive than elsewhere, but I have also found that the cheaper ones go through their standard programme without really addressing problem areas. I will definitely come back and have my tension worked away on this holiday. 	So far, this is probably the best massage place in Koh Samui. I travel to Samui quite often, and I truly believe this is the best massage experience I’ve had. The manager, P’ Noot, was incredibly friendly and welcoming from the moment I stepped in. I had been dealing with piriformis syndrome for the past two months and had tried several massage treatments in Bangkok before coming here. After a two-hour oil massage with P’ Luxe (The masseuse), my pain was significantly reduced, and I felt like a newborn again. On top of that, the spa is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere. I’ll definitely be coming back on my next trip and thanks for the wonderful experience. 	Perfect place for a massage! We had 30 minutes foot massage und 90 minutes aroma oil full body massage and it was just wonderful. Private room, professionell and super massage staff, also asking during procedure if you are okay. Big thank you to Mam and Rue! Would definitively recommend. 	This is the 6th massage place I visited in Thailand. All the places were well checked and with predominantly excellent reviews. This place, as well. The price was a bit higher than other places we have visited during our vacation but decided to give it a go. Once you enter the building, this massage parlor seems to have very very large capacity - many workers and a number of chairs and rooms. I got the oil full body with tiger balm for 60 mins and my wife got the foot massage. My experience was pretty average, I would say even a bit below average. The lady who massaged me was gentle… even too gentle. At the end I was relaxed but expected much more considering the  good rating the place had. At the same time, my wife’s experience was extremely disappointing. She said that her massage was repetitive, petting-like without pressure being applied and due to the air conditioning, she got sore throat. Unfortunately, we left Urban Thai Massage - Chabad House disappointed and will not be coming again. 	Very professional, clean and calming place. We had 2 massages here in our weeks stay to Koh Samui. The foot massage is lovely and I can also recommend the hands and head. My partner had the neck, back and shoulders massage twice and he highly recommends. All the staff are extremely polite and definitely have strong hands. 	We had an excellent experience overall. The place is very nicely maintained with good facilities. The staff was very polite and understanding. The traditional Thai massage itself was out of the world and very refreshing experience. Highly recommended 	Excellent massage, this place has a wide variety of techniques to offer, best massage spot to visit  on Chaweng! 	reviews don't lie, fair price very professional massage. I asked for a strong back and shoulders massage. the lady was super professional it seems she really knows what she's doing. I just came out and felt relieved.
