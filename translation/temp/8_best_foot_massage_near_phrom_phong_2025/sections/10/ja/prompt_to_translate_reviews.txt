This is because Koreans are very picky. If you visit this place, you might feel that spending money at similarly priced or higher-end shops would be a waste. If you found this place on Google Maps, I recommend visiting and getting a massage. 	What a perfect massage experience it was!!!! Super clean building and professional massage therapist who knows the muscle 100% without unnecessary pain at all. The manager of the spa kept an eye on every procedure of massage from your entrance to leaving the spa! I bet that's why the whole thing which includes the quality of massage itself and relaxing atmosphere, etc.. about getting massage is well-managed. SUPER RECOMMENDABLE!!! 	I got a 120min, 4 hand massage here. My experience was really good, warm welcoming, helping, and the massage was really enjoyable, I love the coconut oil, and the teas as well 🙂 I can recommend! Thank you! 	Amazing massage. Went twice for foot then 4 hand massage both which I highly recommend. The spa is tucked in the back of an alley so nice and quiet inside. Super relaxing and great massages! 	I just got back from DIO Spa & Massage in Sukhumvit Soi 22. As a regular traveler to Thailand for over 15 years, this was the most epic treatment i have ever got so far. Amazing massage, by therapist Doung, she is so professional and hard working. 5/5 Stars! 	Been here twice, each time I walk out thinking that was the best massage I'd had. Two years between visits and still outstanding!!  Very relaxing atmosphere and world-class staff. 	Highly recommend, no nonsense, great massage. The building is nice inside with a colonial feel and calm ambience. They open at 10h, I went early. The reception is kind and business-like, I asked for max strength massage and I was quickly assigned a masseuse, Khun Duong, who was super hard working and like a magician got the knots out of my back. I was offered a cool drink on arrival and a warm delicious tea at the end. The experience overall is very professional and sharp. 	Very clean and skill professional! Highly recommended. 	It was a special experience in Bangkok and the massage here should be the best to close the trip happily. Especially, Aromatherapy oil massage & Herbal ball in 90~120mins is highly recommended for the old people. The massagists should have fine and delicate senses and were trying to find pain points for us. Thank you for the good staff for my parents again. 	Do not expected a good service if you are Thai, seems like they don’t wanna get any Thai customers. No one notice me since I arrived, everyone always with their cellphone, not smiling no any service mind at all ( may happens only with Thai) 	I’ve been there 3 times with my friend within one week! Definitely the BEST massage I ever had. Kind owner and staff, reasonable price with good quality oil, literally a paradise place to be. Thank you all!! :) 	It was the perfect massage. They massages the exact lumped muscle position. It was the best time of my trip. The service couldn’t be better. I asked them a favor regarding personal lost and found, and they were very supportive. Highly recommend. 	As I’m sitting here drinking tea after my 2 hour massage. Great professional massage. MIB was excellent with the right amount of pressure. I had the Thai + Aromatherapy massage and location is clean and the service great. Will come again for sure. 	Nice place to get a decent massage. Abit more expensive than the rest along the road but more private and quiet 	I have to admit that this place is one of the top spa for massage in Bangkok. Today was my 4th time already since I started to come here. The place and the staff were super good and would rate this place as 7 star . 	thank u for keeping the lost thing well🙏 even though I arrived late due to the tour, they allowed me to massage until late, so gave a little tip there r a lot of Koreans because of the connection to the tour 	Excellent experience here.  Nam was great at changing pressure when needed.  Plus drinks were given  before and after.
