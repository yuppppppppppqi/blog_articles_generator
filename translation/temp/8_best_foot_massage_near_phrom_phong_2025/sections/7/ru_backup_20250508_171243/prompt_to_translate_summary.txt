After the massage, hot tea and dried fruits are served. I felt completely refreshed! 	We found this shop via FunNow App.  I had an amazing experience here. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was incredibly welcoming. The massage was tailored to my needs, with just the right pressure, leaving me feeling completely rejuvenated. The attention to detail, cleanliness, and calming ambiance made the experience even better. I’ll definitely be returning! 	It was okay when I made the reservation, but it began to be unhappy when I arrived. I agreed when I made a reservation, but I had to wait when I arrived, and I was asked to pay first. I hope the technology can be better, and I will evaluate it when it's over. 	The massage technique here is very bad, and the attitude of the front desk is also bad,literally don’t understand what you said at all. I came according to the evaluation of Google Maps. I have been massaging for many years. And have tried good and bad. This is definitely a bad kind; this masseur can only massage back and forth for several positions and the oil get your feet very bad feeling. In short, spends money but has no sense of enjoyment at all. Not recommended. 	I can highly recommend the massage. For me it was one of the best I've ever had. Very nice ambience. It's absolutely worth paying more. The service is excellent. I had a one-hour aroma massage and the masseur is a real magician. Not the typical rubbing that you usually get from massages. I'll be back. 	One of the best experience ever here in Bangkok for massages. Staff extremely professional and nice, clean rooms, attention for details. I was expecting high level standards considering the reviews: I have not been left disappointed. 	Very comfortable, good environment. The price also very nicely. 	Purchased a package on GoWabi, and the staff welcomed me in and quickly got me up to my room for my massage. The massage was perfect, very relaxing with good pressure and technique to get my knots out.  The space was clean and smelled good. I will be returning soon for another massage. 	There’s a reason why Google and Gowabi have a high rating. I got a Thai massage and it‘s as cool as stretching! I’m tired with a heavy load, but I‘m satisfied. I want to get an oil massage next time!! 	Best experience ever, staff was good and it was really relaxing. Recommend 🥰👍🏽 … 	A great choice. Brand new facilities, very tastefully designed and immaculately clean. Over all great relaxing atmosphere, friendly service, accommodating and good English. The message was superb. Recommend 	A good place to have Thai massage and feel relaxed. Professional massage therapy and hospitality. 	Such a peaceful location. I felt at ease immediately and loved the techniques they used.  The boss was a great host. Shall bring strawberries next time as thank you 😊	I just arrived from Melb this morning and I was very tired. So I was looking for the massage and I found this place, The therapist was incredible and professional but I forgot to ask her name 😂. Every staff were very friendly, Good place. Highly recommend. ขอบคุณครับ🙏🏻🙏🏻 … 	Was looking around Asok and found this place just up the road and OMG it was so good. My body feels so relaxed and my muscles are chilled.  Staff were so friendly and helpful.  Totally recommend!!! And as a side bonus a 7-eleven is just next door.  Would I come here again=yes 	One of the best experiences. Aroma massage is for people who wants to relax. Super friendly staff, they do their best yo make you feel comfortable😊 … 	Very good Thai massage experience here with the therapist name “p’Ya” love it!! It was my 2”1st time but will come more
