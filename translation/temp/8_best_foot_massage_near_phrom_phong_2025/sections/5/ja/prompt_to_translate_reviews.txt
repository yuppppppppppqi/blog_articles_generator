The staffs welcomed us with so much warmth and love. The treatment in itself was marvellous. It was so good that both of us snored at some point during the process. They were the very friendly, very communicative, very lovely each and everyone of them. At the end, both me and hubby were surprised by the staff for their thoughts and dedication to making our experience an out of the world one. They offered us a very big bouquet of roses and the most sweetest and cutest of cake ever to celebrate our anniversary. I was over the moon from the whole experience. Looking forward to coming back soon 🩷🩷🥰🥰  We were asked from the very start of any allergies we have. We were given the choice of aroma we wanted in our massage. Their washroom is so clean. Overall a 100 stars for the whole experience 	One of the best thai massage experiences I’ve had in Bangkok. From the warm welcome to the treatment itself and the tea in the end, everything went well. Special thanks to miss First for the massage. Definitely more expensive than your random massage parlor on Sukhumvit Road but better value for money. 	OMG! I was blown away by the Deep Tissue (90mins) and Intensive Facial - Aesop Products (60mins), both by masseur Ms. Rin. Walking into the spa being greeted by a gentleman staff (I’m sorry I forgot your name!) so warmly, it felt like a 5 star hotel spa and indeed they were! I was welcomed by their Detox blue drink whilst the staff chatted with me on the art gallery displaying of local artists artworks next to it. (Love this as a visual artist myself, I applaud them for creating a platform for local talents.)  Don’t be fooled by the masseur Ms. Rin’s physique cause she gave me the best massage I’ve had here in BKK! She might be young but she massages like a pro who has been doing this all her life! I was floating in heaven from her medium-hard massage and her facial was simply awesome too! This spa was not far by distance from my hotel but the usual horrendous traffic BKK is known far is something to consider if you can’t walk to it. But nevertheless no regrets here, because from start to finish I was treated like a queen as you’re served with a teapot of tea with come local sweets after your massage! Price point wise, they are expensive by local standard but their quality is above and beyond! My experience here was worth every dime! 	We had such a lovely experience at this thai spa called NAKHON. We brought my mother in for a massage, and she came out absolutely glowing — she said it was one of the best massages she’s ever had. The staff were incredibly gentle, respectful, and professional. They took the time to ask about her preferences and made sure she was comfortable throughout the entire session.  While my dad and I waited, the staff offered us complimentary drinks and made us feel very welcome. The waiting area was quiet and cozy and amazing view of Bangkok!  — a great place to relax. After my mom finished, they surprised us with free mango sticky rice, which was such a thoughtful and delicious treat.  It wasn’t just a massage — it felt like a full experience of Thai hospitality. You can really tell they care about their guests. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and be treated with genuine warmth. We’ll definitely come back the next time we’re in Bangkok! 	I highly recommend the Loft Thai Spa! They offer an excellent services, I’m very impressed by Loft’s attention to every single detail, design, customer service, hello and goodbye drinks, high quality products and professional massage therapists. My 2 hours Lavender oil massage was the perfect way to unwind, relax and it was worth every penny. My massage therapist Ms.Nee was very professional, highly skilled, kind and I felt very looked after. Will be back soon! Thank you Loft ! 	A Heavenly Thai Massage Retreat - [LOFT THAI]  Walking into [LOFT THAI], I was instantly charmed by the warm Thai decor and inviting aroma. The staff greeted me with huge smiles, making me feel right at home.  The massage therapists are true pros. Their skillful hands, well-versed in traditional Thai techniques, worked wonders on my tired muscles. Knots I'd carried for ages melted away under their firm yet gentle pressure.  An hour there felt like a mini-vacation for my body and mind. If you're after relaxation and rejuvenation, this place is a must-try! Five stars, hands down! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 	One of the best massage ever. Ambiance was very relaxing and great too. Therapist were courteous and good. We had First & Nee, they are both good will be back the next time! ☺️ 	I was hesitant to spend so much money on a gentleman's Hydrafacial, but wow what a memorable experience. My therapist Jasmine was amazing, from the moment I walked in the door everything was perfect, the staff were all very friendly and attentive. The facial was unbelievably good, everything Jasmine did was peaceful and done so delicately. It was worth the money and I am now leaving feeling so refreshed and good about myself. 	I’m here on a last stop for a four month voyage! I came here to Loft Thai reviews! It did not disappoint. You must come here!  Lek give me the best Hydro facial I’ve ever had. It was 90 minutes:  micro dermabrasion, Hydro Facial getting all the junk out, aloe vera serum. She massages you for l10 minutes then there’s another coconut oil serum, she lifts up your skin with a great fade tool. Next comes the green tea/honey/yogurt face mask with steam. At certain times she massages your head, your neck, your temples. Finally, she washes off the skin, puts another serum on  and sunscreen!  They give Top Class customer service! They served me: hot tea, butterfly cold, tea, and the most amazing little sweet potato and coconut treats. They treated me with kindness and the BEST service! 	After few days of holding my pain n decided to come this place because of their good on google review, the staff here very helpful, they help me choose the Sport Massage, which is wonderful, my pain is much more better now. Thank you all of you! Would definitely come back again n they have such a beautiful decoration there. 	I have come to Loftai with Office Syndrome Massarge due to stress and pain in my shoulders. The massage staff is very good, so I can relax and reduce my muscle aches. Good service and location, I recommend and will definitely come back. 	Really lovely and luxurious massage. I chose the lady package included a foot scrub, full body massage and an Aseop facial at the end. For everything it cost ฿4000. It was very peaceful and relaxing I fell asleep! You get your own private room and there is a shower afterwards as well. The spa itself is very beautiful and aesthetic, it’s a nice treat to go here! 	Clean massage place. I had a relaxing time with my spouse here at Loft Thai spa, and we throughoutly enjoyed ourself with the Couple Indulgence. 10/10 will be back 	Great ambience and extra friendly staff.  I booked a deep tissue massage and was not disappointed.  The masseuse was highly skilled and worked out tension I was storing in my neck, shoulders, and back.  Ultimately I was relaxed and tension free.  Definitely would do again.  Book early as this location is popular. 	This spa is conveniently located very close to the sky train (BTS), it is a little bit of a walk but not too far. It is located in a small alleyway. It was an absolutely delightful experience. I redeemed a voucher here and I didn’t realize I had two but the hosts were extremely kind and helpful. They created a really calm and welcoming atmosphere. We were welcomed with some ice cold sweet tea that was perfect because it was sweltering hot outside. They had a quick questionnaire about any problem areas to focus on, strength of massage and what places to avoid. This place is a great place to experience the famous Bangkok Thai massage with the opportunity to add on to your initial package. Had I known about this place earlier in my trip I would have visited a number of times before I left. We were allowed to wind down in the foyer with some traditional Thai rice cakes and hot tea.  Business that take the time to master customer service are businesses bound for success. This is one of those businesses. 	Seriously top class service very professional I went for the Thai Warrior style massage it was excellent . I’ve never really experienced before anything like it before Great ancient authentic technique strong massage not recommended for newbies.  Aesthetic beautiful like Aesop vibes minimal luxury decor very consistent little bit pricey but worth it 	Walked in to Loft Thai Spa via google without an appt. Was treated with a very warm welcome by the staff. Managed to arrange a hot compress massage withij 5mins of waiting and also allowed me to take a quick shower before the treatment. The therapist was skilful and I felt so much better from the body aches after the massage. Thank you to the front desk staff who arranged everything so seamlessly! Will definitely come again in future trips to BKk! Highly recommended!
