Ladies are great masseuses and very charmig, respectful and caring. Not only I recommend but i will go back! Robes, towels and shoes provided. We got a Siamese Aromatherapy Oil Massage + Hot Herbal Compress (120min) and tea at the end! Winner option! 	I had a well spent 60 mins with oil massage here. The staffs are well trained with a friendly service mind. The room is nice and clean. Plus, the staff at the counter also provide an excellence suggestion and service to help me understand their services. This also help me to choose the right program :) 	June, is a good listener, Made sure to apply the right amount pressure at the right place… My body feels rejuvenated… I’d recommend to come here… Soi 22 Thai Thai Massage is very clean and well Organised.. 	Had an amazing visit at Thai Thai. The staff was talented, the environment was soothing, and the massage itself was first-rate. Just the ideal mix of pressure and relaxation.  Perfect for decompressing following an exhausting day.  Strongly advised for everyone seeking a real Thai massage. 	Excellent service and treatment at Thai Thai massage!  The foot 👣 massage is one of the best I've ever had, very worth the money 💰 They also accept credit cards 💳 for all services, so that is definitely an added bonus for me, as I prefer not to have a wallet filled with cash walking around Bangkok.  Definitely a good place to drop by for some relaxing 😌 and wonderful friendly staff 😀 do drop by for sure 😁 	Had a really good oil massage here. The therapist, Noon, was lovely and had strong hands with excellent technique 💪✨  very professional and attentive. The room was clean, relaxing 🧼🕯️, and the massage oil felt high quality. It’s a bit on the pricey side 💸, but definitely worth it for the experience. I also appreciated the small touch at the end they served a really delicious tea 🍵 after the treatment. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quality massage! 🌸 	I always go to this chain of massage salons. This is the best massage in Bangkok. Everything is new and clean, and the staff is great. The massage is worth the price, and I recommend it to everyone! 	Absolutely amazing!!! I got there by chance and boy, what a wonderful surprise it was. I had an oil aromatherapy massage, and I suffer from nimblling arms and back pains. I wondered to myself at what stage should I tell about it but felt so secure by the extremely professional masseuse (Fong) that I kept my thoughts to myself and let her do the magic. I immediately felt much better what I could barely say after long treatments by physiotherapists back home. Thank you so much, Fong!!! Thank you, Thai Thai massage!!! 	I loooove this place! It is located right next to Marriott Marqui Queen’s Park. I have been here twice already within two days. I have 5 more days on my trip & I will be back to try a couple other services.  They are currently running a BOGO free special on select services. I brought my mom to try this place after my initial visit. I did the Thai massage & the Siamese Aromatherapy Oil Massage + Hot Compress (this is one of the buy one get one free options). Both were awesome! the staff is friendly and the place is very clean & cute. 	Excellent service. Very friendly staff and able to accommodate to your massage needs. Clean and tidy place.  Price was very affordable as they have an ongoing promotion at 50% every 2nd service.  Would come back again! 	The decoration of the place and the colors are the most eye-catching in this area, The introduction of  details in each menu from the counter is quite fair and honest with customers, The interior of the place is clean and there are no staff talking loudly inside, It is really professional image, The staff are so polite and pay attention to her work, I felt this in my 90 minutes, I really appreciate it, anyway one thing I must say is... first I,m sure that not all of staff are the same but my experience (different staff) at second time was not good at first time, >> when customer asked for relaxing massage and not too hard massage,,, as human beings  must listen to this,  staff should not push customer to take the pain, when customer asked to stop,,,it's painful, then stop it and do it softer, gently,  if the customer asked for relaxing, not too hard, so just do it, however I still give the tip to staff as the same just like the first time, but the experience was not good. 	Came for the second time and was 😍 amazed how good the therapist was this time I got a chance to get relaxed my therapist kati was so good with her work especially when I asked her to apply some more pressure and she was kind enough to ensure she could try her best .this place makes me feel so relaxed .I just did a foot massage which was extremely relaxing.thank you 	The most proper way to relax. A few dollars more can get you very far away. Remember to tip these nice friendly ladies. The bright atmosphere makes huge contrast to their neighbours. Located right in the middle of the shopping and the hotel areas. The door is bright and easy to find. 	It was an amazing experience. The place was clean and calm and service was top notch. It's a must go place in bangkok 	I had an amazing experience at the place. Very kind and great massage. Clean and friendly.	The thai massage nearly emsphere is very reasonable price and staff are kindly and also friendly if you giy looking for the authentic thai massage i would like to recommend to vist thai thai massage so incredible relax😊 … 	I’ve had one of the best massage at Thai Thai , Manao the masseuse was very professional, and worked well on my stiff and muscles. I highly recommend this place .
