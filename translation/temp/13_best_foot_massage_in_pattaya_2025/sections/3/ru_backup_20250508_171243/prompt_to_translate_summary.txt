I decided to spend a bit more, and it was well worth it. The establishment is very clean, peaceful, and features traditional Thai massage rooms with soothing music. The masseuse was highly professional, well trained, and provided top notch service. Highly recommended. I’ll definitely be only coming back to her while in pattaya. 	The place is clean and masseuse are experienced. Their rates are competitive. Nui did a great job. Happy with the experience 	Been coming here for 7 years, best massage in Pattaya in my opinion, my wife is an ex masseuse and she loves it here too, the standard is amazing and most of ladies here haven't changed over the years which says a lot about a business 	super worthy ,one hour Thai massage was only 200 BHT , nice place and clean atmosphere. 	📌Masseuse are very professional, friendly and work there for almost ten years. There are like 20 of staffs there.  📌 Offered private massage room with shower and private wooden sauna room.  📌This is the best place to get massage for me when I stay in Central Pattaya.  📌My masseuse is Nui but everyone is also great. 	This place is very authentic. By far clean and original experience of Thai massage. After comparison this place stand out for it technique. 	Had great Thai Massage, highly recommended. 	A very cozy massage place that is also a hostel. Really good quality massage, with proper pressure and application. Friendly staff who knows what they are doing.	Highly recommended! So glad we chose this place. We feel brand new!  We each had a 1.5hr traditional and medicinal Thai massage. The staff was highly skilled, courteous, and professional. They communicated with us regularly to check our comfort level.  I would not have chosen this place based on the name but locals on a Thai forum (similar to Reddit) recommended this place, so we came. The owners are strict Buddhist vegans so the staff are rigorously vetted and held to high moral standards. No funny business or happy ending massages here. They will heal you.  If you're not used to the rigor of Thai massages, just let them know. They'll adjust accordingly. Positive Communication, Professionalism	My husband and I went there for few massages: feet, back and thai. We were impressed by ladies professionalism and how good we both felt after. I had a problem with my shoulders and back and the lady was able to locate the stiff areas right away and work on them. Feet massage was exellent and relaxing. The place is very plesant and clean. Overall had a great experience! Recommended! 	In search of a good massage shop brought me by Asian Art Massage. I could recommend this shop for everyone who's in need for a good massage, instead of all the so called "boom boom massages".  The women out here are really professional and even if you tell them that you have an injury they try to do everything they could to take the best care of.  Along Pattaya you have many shops were all the staff sitting outside and saying things like "welcome" "massage" all the time, it is like a bit annoying, this place however doesnt have any staff sitting outside.  They gently sitting inside and don't talk that loud or much to each other, in the shop itself there is even a sign where they kindly ask you to not speak out loudly. The guy who's sitting next to me enjoyed his foot massage so good, that he felt asleep within less then 15minutes I would say.  Again all the women here are really professional and take good care of you. I really really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good massage. And I would suggest that you inform them if you have any injuries they could take care of. 	My girlfriend asked not to do so strong massage a lot of times. The masseuse just laughed at it. It was very painful. She was almost crying. And: no excuses about that! We even said this fact to them, trying to understand why could it be possible. No excuses at all. And this salon seems to be the best in the area? Disgusting. 	I'm coming back to this place for the second time! My first time here was for back & shoulder massage, and the lady tried to work on my muscle knots and pressure points on my shoulder. She knows what she's doing, which is lucky for me since I'm picky about neck massage. My headache and the soreness on my shoulder reduced a lot that evening. 	Absolutely Amazing Team, well trained and amazing hands. Glad I read reviews here, I think place is recently renovated and I was tired after long travel reached before their opening time and they gladly offered foot massage. Even the body massage was perfect. Masses knew each point and works on it. Best Health Massage I had in Pattaya till now. Goin to be there every day of my stay. 	Good massage.. Had 1 hour feet and 1 hour Thai massage.. But Thai massage was hard.. In the end u feel  as if u worked out but relaxed. All in all it is a good way to spend some of your time enjoying the massage before going to party or after a long day of walking around the city. Either way u will feel positive and thankful mentally spiritually and your body muscles relaxed in many ways u did not feel before especially with the Thai massage stretching your muscles and nerves to the limit.. And trust me u will be coming for more next day and the day after that I know I did and the best part is the cheap and fair price your paying for it because this service can cost u 10 times more in your country so enjoy it as much u can while u are there. Don't take it for granted benefit max..talking about myself I am happy I did;I was going to massage places every single day and even there was days I was having massage twice a day and now that I am back home and writing this review I know for sure my money was well spent. Also they have hundreds of massage places with or without happy ending and boom boom it really depends what you want.. so Good luck for you. 	My partner and I went there for 2 hours each for Thai and oil massage. It’s nice atmosphere with private room but my message therapy is poor of service mind and treatment. She didn’t listen what kind of massage I asked and of course I am a Thai speaker so language isn’t a point. The worst she poked me like 3 times to asked me to turn around or lay on my back instead of telling me. Disappointing, it’s the fist and the last time. 	I guess this is the best spa in this area. Especially because of one masseuse. Her name is Bokko. Highly recommend! She has special energy, maybe you can feel that is it too strong, but nothing worried you on the next day. Trust her, she knows exactly what she is doing. I had a lot of pain before Bokko, after 2 sessions I feel much better, nobody can help me before. It’s a shame, that I don’t have  time to stay in Pattaya longer, but now I have reason to come back! Thanks a lot ❤️
