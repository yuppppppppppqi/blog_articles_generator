If you get tired from shopping, you must come here to relax. They offer massages of different durations ranging from 1 to 4 hours. They even have colorful menus in three languages, which is very considerate! As shown in the picture, you can freely choose the massage style you like. My friend and I got relaxed here. We will definitely come again if we have the chance! 	I found this place online, and the environment is clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly, and the massage was both relaxing and had just the right amount of pressure. I also had a foot injury, and the staff thoughtfully applied medicine for me, which was really heartwarming. The service here is excellent, and I highly recommend it. After the massage, they even provided fruit and ginger tea to enjoy. 	I walked in without a reservation, and the receptionist assured me that he could arrange something within 15 minutes. True to his word, the session was ready to start in exactly 10 minutes—much more convenient than other spas that require advance booking.  The environment and service were both excellent, with the massage quality meeting high standards. A special highlight was the complimentary fruit after the session—it was incredibly sweet. Plus, the location is easy to find, right near the night market. Definitely worth recommending! 	I just had the most incredible one-hour massage experience! From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel completely at ease. They even provided refreshing drinks to enjoy throughout the session. The massage itself was deeply relaxing, leaving me feeling completely rejuvenated and at peace. It was such a unique and soothing experience that I’ll definitely be coming back for more. Thank you! 	I just had the strongest Thai massage of my life at Siamdara! I was actually planning to go to Zabai, but it was closed for Songkran, so I ended up here—and I’m so glad I did. The environment was soothing and relaxing, and they took the time to ask about my preferences via a questionnaire before starting. I requested a strong massage, and I didn’t have to keep asking for more pressure—the masseur (named Male) delivered perfectly. If you’re looking for serious tension release and a personalized experience, this is the place. 	One of the best massages I’ve had in Thailand for months! I had the 2 hour back, neck and shoulder and asked for a hard pressure to focus on my traps. The therapist did that and more, it was fab and I felt great at the end. Highly recommend and will be going back next time I’m in Chiang Mai. The service at reception was great as well, a drink on arrival and after the massage plus fresh fruit. The whole experience was wonderful ☺️ 	The staff here is so nice and friendly, and the massage is great too. Btw, love the fresh fruits after massage. Highly recommend!! 	Professional, warmth & friendly staff. Thai massage with hot press for 2 hours. Fantastic experience. Very relaxing and help my muscles heal after 2 weeks of long drives around Thailand. In Chiang Mai, will come again. Highly recommended. 	Very nice massage! They used tiger balm before the massage and it really helped relax! The location is good and the staff are all very nice, highly recommended! 	Very clean, very nice service. Hibiscus tea before the treatment and ginger tea with fruits at the end:) 	Great massage, perfect for those who like to choose their massage strength. Nice and polite staff! 	Good environment. Massage skill is good and comfortable. Good experience overall 	Everything was super nice! We walked in and got a spot for a couple’s massage straight away. Before the massage they gave us an iced drink and scrubbed our feet. After the massage we were goven ginger honey tea and some fresh fruit. The people working were very nice and attentive. I definetly recommend! Good value for the price! 	I have enjoyed the two-hour full body massage (there is promo, 750baht). The staffs are nice and the atmosphere is good. Overall, good massage experience here! :) 	Very good experience here. The shop is clean and the staff are professional. They provide you with drinks and fruit which is a nice touch. Went for the medium strength back and shoulder massage and it was pretty strong at certain points. Overall had a lovely time here. 	amazing..! perfect massage, kind workers I want to come again 	First time having Thai massage. It was 2 hours for 750 baht. Super accommodating. Make sure to book appointment as they can get busy. Gives tea and fruits.
