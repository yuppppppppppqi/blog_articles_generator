It was the best massage I received in Thailand. I am willing to revisit. 😀 … 	Visited thrice during our trip as it was walking distance from our hotel. Clean and relaxing environment and good massage. The Khao taen served at the end of the massage was so yummy we ended up buying some as souvenirs!  We were in a couples room and the only complaint is the masseuses were chatting for the first 10min during the massage. 	Absolutely impressed by the services. This was my first time getting a Traditional thai massage and I had a moderate shoulder and back pain issue. I must admit it was completely resolved after the 60 min of Thai massage. And how they greet is what makes you comfortable in their environment. Loved every bit of it. Highly recommend!! 	Got the traditional Thai massage with balm for 600 baht for 60 min. It's pricier but also a higher tier of ambience and skill. Specifically, they had dedicated rooms with real, elevated massage tables so I didn't have to squish my neck facing one direction on a flat surface.  Masseuse provided a good level of pressure (I prefer strong massages), and focused on the areas I specified on the intake form (vs following a standard sequence).  	We googled for spa with shower as we planned to massage, shower then go back to hotel to collect luggage and head off to airport for evening flight. In the couple room, there is ensuite toilet and shower stall, also a changing stall with hangers and full length mirror. In the shower, u find shampoo and shower gel. The staff also brot me a hair dryer, how considerate of them! Maybe it's their usu practice or bec we are here on off peak, no one hurried me as I shower and  changed. Both my hubby and I had the most relaxing massage we both dozed off. I had aroma oil body massage and Indian head massage which was also very relaxing with warm oil drizzled onto your scalp, scalp, shoulder and neck massage. Would help highly recommend to anyone wanting to while time after checkout. 	It was the best foot massage I’ve ever had! Perfect amount of pressure and nice scrub before. Would recommend :) 	Visiting from the US, my friend and I walked by this establishment during the vibrant chaos and whimsy of water fights for Songkran. After a little splash from some of the staff :0) , we took a look at the menu of options and walked inside. As last minute guests, they offered immediate foot massages. A full body would be available later that evening. But we were open to foot massages in the moment!  I spoke with the owner for a little while, as we waited, who is so kind and friendly and has such a joy for Thailand, as a transplant. He manages a clean, serene space that feels like a little slice of paradise behind the entry door. And the staff seems so cheerful and eager to serve and connect.  We had Laa and Benz to massage us, who are both very wonderful, warm, hospitable. They spent time chatting with us and teaching us Thai words. I showed Laa a photo of my ankle from two months ago to let her know that I had sustained a severe sprain. She took extra care to be gentle and give me a tiger balm type ointment to soothe the muscle. I appreciate that nurturing spirit.  Overall, we had an excellent experience, relaxing and calm and enjoyable. We would recommend this place to anyone! 	The massages at ChabaPrai are amazing - and great value. When you arrive, you are served cool tea and rice cakes. The foot massage begins with a foot scrub in flower infused water. There’s also fragrant flowers in a bowl under the face hole in the massage table. The head, neck, shoulder back massage will be extended to legs and arms too.  Only drawbacks: The massage tables (as all in Thailand) are harder than in the US and they don’t put pillows or bolsters under your knees when you’re lying on your back. The quality and value of the massages more than make up for that 	For the first time ever we've had a traditional Thai full body massage and we absolutely loved it! The women were so kind and the ambiance is great. We truely feel rejuvenated and that the energy can flow again. Thank you so much! 	Best experience!  Everyone was kind and very professional. We got a cold tea and towel as we entered and a warm tea and a rice treat to end the massage. It was honestly more than expected and would definitely recommend ! Thank you !! ✨ 	Definitely one of the best places for traditional Thai massage in Chiang Mai, I can only recommend it Nicely decorated, clean, good service 	We had amazing massages and facials. The service was great, the environment was relaxing, and we came out rejuvenated and very happy. Highly recommend! 	Came here based on proximity to hotel and reviews. I was not dissapointed - It is the best Thai massage I've ever had, and I would actually go to far as to say the best massage I've ever had. Incredibly skill. Great relaxing atmosphere.	I had an aroma oil massage here and absolutely loved it! It was at the branch opposite De Lanna Hotel on Intrawarorot Road - a very clean and spacious place with a relaxing ambience. The staff were friendly, welcoming, and well-informed. Great value for the top quality service you will get at this masssge spa. Highly recommended! 	My husband and I had wonderful head to toe massage! Just what we needed after a long day of travel yesterday. We did the Duo package #5! Great deal as well for 2 hours. 	Very good massage! They start with a little welcome drink and a chart where you can select which body parts you want them to focus on as well as the intensity of the massage. The rooms are private and extremely clean. Definitely recommend it! 	Best Thai massage I’ve ever had. Been to three places in Thailand and had two in London. This is the best I’ve had of all of them.
