I came here together with my friends, and we both are amazed by the skills and technique of the masseuse. We both tried oil massage and dare to say it was one of the best experience we had in chiang mai. The price is friendlier than in old town, but the quality is unbeatable. Everyone is welcoming and kind. I would love to be back again. 	We tried several massage places near our hotel and this was by far the best. We tried Aiyaret and it was just average, even though it's got great reviews. Kunlarat was an instant success - went for the Thai full body 60 minutes and it was SO good. Shivers down the spine! The parlour is basic inside but clean and professional.  We went back three more times and had different massages including reflexology and they were all great. Masseuses called Beauty and Tintin were THE BEST and we asked for them specifically each time. Oh and there's a very nice cat that occasionally comes out of the back room to see what's going on 😻 	Had the best foot massage and the best neck/shoulder/back massage I have had so far after 4 months in Asia. Perfect intensity and got all my shoulder knots out ! Absolutely 10/10 for both massages! Lovely clean environment with enthusiastic and very talented staff! Definitely go here ! 💛 :) xxx 	Visited this spot twice because I enjoyed it so much! Lala did wonders for my lower back issues, I left feeling reborn. I appreciated how she really took time to focus on the areas I mentioned. Mindful, kind and consistent experience! 	I tried this massage shop two days ago and I found the staff ( Manager - Bee in black and the owner in green)  all are very nice. As I am a very demanding person, I chatted with the Bee that I looked the best Masseur here. Bee introduced Dao (a young Thai girl in red as shown in the picture below) to me, and I have a 2-hour oil massage. Dao entertained all my requests, including the deep tissue massage for my right upper hand and shoulder. Her skills were very, very good. After having the oil massage for consecutive 2 days, I could feel my upper hand and shoulder were greatly improved. Although there is no pricey decoration, they have a warm atmosphere and good massage skills. 	I have been through many message shops in Chiangmai, Kunlarat is my favorite. The services are high quality and the prices are low. I always come to this shop when I am in changklan road. Sometimes I forgot to make a reservation, I have to wait for a little bit, but the good service worth the waiting. 	The best massage in Thailand so far. Very cozy and clean space. Very nice therapist. We will be back! ❤️ 	I had the BEST Thai massage here! The Place was so clean. Staff were so friendly and professional. They totally knew what they were doing. Needless to say i came back for an oil Massage and then at another time for a foot Massage. Maybe I’ll come back again today;) I couldn’t recommend this place more. Made for a most memorable first visit for me here in Chiang Mai! 	The service was really good. The workers were kind and attentive. They provide water and help you if needed. The actual massage itself was great; they loosened my foot, stretched it gently and everything was relaxing & calm. They ended the massage with loosening my neck and back. This was just the foot massage, but there were other options. 	I've been here daily for two weeks. I've gotten to know the team and owner, they are incredibly kind.  The massages are consistently great and I can't recommend it enough :) 	One hour Full Body oil massage. It was really relaxing, not as hard as other massage places might be but perfect for pain relief and relaxation. Can recommend. (Music and a nice smell would be great) 	Very professional and clean. Excellent services are offered by the staff. It can be hard to get deep tissue in Thailand but this place comes to the rescue. Their massage services can fill up fast because they are good (and everyone knows it!) so you may want to book in advance. Thank you for taking care of us and keep up the amazing work! Can't wait to see you again! 	I experienced 4 massage places in Chiang mai, this place is the best one! She did it really carefully, effectively, all my pain is relieved! love it and will comeback when having chance 	Excellent service!!! I googled Ashiatsu Massage, and it brought up their business and it wasn’t on their menu. I’m sure I’m butchering her name, but Zak Zdah was EXCELLENT!!! Using her body weight to hit the pressure points in my calves 🥰🥰🥰  If I were in Chiang Mai / Thailand longer I would go again… 🔥🔥🔥 	In need of deep tissue massage I was recommended to try Kunlarat. The service was excellent - very professional but also very personal. My therapist targeted the more sensitive parts of my body very caring and with enormous skill. The stretches at the end of the massage felt more individual than in a traditional Thai massage and suited me perfectly. Thanks - Just booked another session. 	There are a lot of massage places to choose from and cannot recommend this one enough! I went here everyday of my trip to Chiang Mai. Great value, professional, and clean. Highly recommend 	We have visited here multiple times during our stay in Chiang Mai and we have been very pleased. The staff and lovely and friendly and skilled at their jobs. There are so many places to choose from, it can be overwhelming, but we’re very glad with our choice.
