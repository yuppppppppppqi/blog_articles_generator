I can find my solution here. and they fixed my back. this place makes my back so much better. I'm happy to recommend  this place to everyone. here is Number 1 of my massage experiences in Thailand. I'm in Thailand every year from 2005 until now here is the best. 	This was by far the best massage I’ve ever had. amazing job!"  The lady was professional her technique was perfect—combining the right amount of pressure and skill to relieve tension in all the right spots. I left feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a top-notch massage experience. I’ll definitely be booking with her again!" 	I would not recommend this place for real massage. If you look for a place to hang out with friends while someone massages your foot, then it's okay. But i doubt you will do that. 	Love love it! Had a 1 hour facial done, and a 30 minute calve and foot massage. They used so many amazing products on my skin, left it feeling so rejuvenated and alive. The staff are so friendly and accommodated me so well. I had both treatments done the same time, felt like a queen. Would highly recommend! Feeling great 	Worst massage of my life and being south East Asian, I’ve gotten many. Me and my family got body massages there this evening and it was extremely disappointing. I would consider the many other options around.  Firstly, one of us requested a Thai traditional massage but they messed up and gave him an oil massage instead.  the masseuses were weak. And lack strength despite 2 of us asking repeatedly for more strength to be applied. It felt like a child caressing and patting me instead.  The owner (man) later apologised and confessed that the masseuses he had given us were new to the job.  Terrible service. If the masseuses are not well trained yet please don’t assign them to customers. It’s unprofessional and we are full paying customers.  Owner told us that if we come back for another massage tomorrow he would give us a better staff and still charged us full price, despite me telling him that it was my last day in Krabi. 🙄  I would take the good Google reviews of this place with a pinch of salt. It’s a massage place that just wants to service as many customers as possible with no regard to ensuring good quality. 	It's a nice place where we can talk and tell our massage needs, whether it's hand pressure or specific acupressure. The staffs are lovely. 	Went there for a 90 min oil massage.   A price was agreed upon and everything went well and we tipped the ladies.  Came back for a second massage a few days later and at the end of it the manager tried to ask for and extra 200baht each for both sessions (totalling 400 baht) claiming that the masseuse under charged us even tho she rang the manager and got a price at the start.  I feel this is a ploy the manager uses to get some extra cash on top of the original price.   Very disappointing as the massage itself and the ladies that did the massage were very nice.   Manager / owner is the issue. 	Talented and friendly staff, Loved their massage and the clean spa provide many services besides the health services, such as Lashes and and eye brows.. Manicure and eyeliner.. 	I just had the best massage of my life! The therapist was incredibly skilled, and every movement felt perfectly tailored to release tension and stress.I walked out feeling rejuvenated, lighter, and totally refreshed. Highly recommend this place 	If you would like to have a real Thai massage please don’t come here… we spent an hour for nothing feel like massage.. Only oil with pushing not massaging Anyway, I am real Thai 	Both me and my partner had a Thai / oil massage there every day during our stay in Krabi. The staff is very nice and the lady who owns the place is very communicative in English and super kind. The studio is quite new, very clean. 	I wonder where all these positive reviews came from. Nobody spoke English, hence I couldn’t communicate with anyone. After mayor surgery and back problems for years I found it important to have someone experienced but instead I got an incredibly painful oil massage. 	The manager is super accommodating and fit our group in pretty quickly even though we showed up pretty late in the evening. My friend and I enjoyed our pedicures, and our whole group had nice massages.  However, the atmosphere here is far from relaxing. The staff is constantly chatting, and it was clear that they were talking about other clients. Also, they seem short staffed (again, I understand since they fit us in quickly at the end of the night) but the manager continued to wave new clients in even though there already weren’t enough masseuses. She got up several times during my massage to help other clients and to make calls. This atmosphere was chaotic and unprofessional.  Again, we really enjoyed our massages, but I wish the atmosphere was more peaceful. 	This was a scam. We went for a 1hr massage, and they wouldn’t do it because they were only available for 30min. They convinced us by telling we would pay only half of it (half of 1hr price), and explicitly said the amount. Then at the end after the massage, they charged us more money than the initial offered price. The lady in charge was rude and she + another lady were screaming just to intimidate us…. and since we didn’t want to end our day with a bad experience, we just paid whatever they asked and left. The massage was more than the average, and with so many options around, I wouldn’t recommend this place. 	My friends and I I had several foot massages and a back/neck massage. The place is clean and cozy and the ladies are amazing. Prices are also very fair and it can be perfectly combined with the AoNang night and food market. Also special thanks to Yum who did a great job on the back massage and had a great sense of humour. Thanks for everything and we‘ll certainly check-in should we ever get back to Krabi. Only attention point and potential room for improvement is the music system that is not working well and that is somehow disturbing the cozy massage atmosphere.	The best place ever for donig massage.. they doing excellent job 	We picked the foot massage and one manicure. The massage was fine but the manicure service was rude and hurting hands. When we did a remark, she rolled her eyes and sighed. She talked like she was annoyed when we told her it hurted. It kinda annoyed us. In the end, even though we paid for the service, she told all of us to get out when she didn’t finish the manicure. We didn’t even get a refund for it.
