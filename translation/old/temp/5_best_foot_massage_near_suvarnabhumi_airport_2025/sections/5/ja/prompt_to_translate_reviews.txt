The massage felt like it was my first one in the great city of Bangkok. The masseuse was well experienced & gave a consent form to ensure customers were well taken care of.  Owner is a nice lady & her command of English is decent in a conversation.  Thank you & I hope to come again! 	Highly recommending. Tried Thai massage balm oil for 90 minutes. Very relaxing, peaceful and calm. Neatly maintained washrooms for bath with quality toiletries. They serve green tea at the end with savoury. Best for ladies travelling alone. 	Came for a 1h foot massage with my gf. The service we received was truly outstanding. They really do their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The massage covered all the right spots. The pressure was perfect. Hygiene is also top notch. I have been to countless massage places and this is easily in my top 3. 	The best massage in Thailand so far!!! It’s my 5th time in Thailand, went to many different massage places but never had such an experience. Coming back for sure and definitely recommend to you :)) 	While prices are same as in other places, this place looks more professional than average Bangkok massage parlour. 	Very good massage, friendly, cheap. I promptly after s great foot massage stayed for 1 hour body massage 	I fully recommend here. Almost all of staff can speak english a little bit. One of tip for you, here Boss is best therapist! And her english is enough good. But usually she very busy. If you are lucky then take a massage from her. Really, here is one of  best massage shop in Bangkok. And I think here is the best cost effectiveness place! 	A down to earth massage parlour.. been here a couple of times and never disappoints. Price is reasonable, and the therapists were good and experienced. Will definitely visit here again! 	Best massage I ever had - in the world - without reservation. Foot or full body, you cannot go wrong. I had the full body Thai Oil Massage 1 1/2 hours - TWICE in two days! 😄 and also enjoyed a 1-hour foot massage.  The owner speaks enough English to understand and communicate clearly. The entire staff are very polite, efficient, and skilled. Prices are also very reasonable with the exchange rate from the US dollar… around $21 (700 baht) with tip included. Highly recommend! 	We have the best experience of Thai Massage, herbal heating stone. Highly recommend this place. My muscle tension for many years have been relieved a lot and I feel much better with just 1 therapy. Feeling thankful. 	Its a small thai massage shop, where you can get an original thai massage from 200 bahts, like 6 euros for an hour of massage... Especcially search for Mrs. NUT, a little older but very expirience massus, and after an hour treatment, you will definetly feel much better 😀😃 DEFINETLY RECOMENDED	Best Thai massage I have had on this trip. The shop is clean and we'll looked after. The staff were friendly and professional.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for a good massage in Bangkok.	First time i went there today.  The massage is very good.  They are very good people. Warm welcome i love it. The speak very good and lovely people  I enjoyed a lot the massage after massage feel light and good.  I will go again for sure because i enjoyed a lot  Thank you very much 🙏 had a very good time there ❤️	Very nice place, clean and professional. All of them are well trained, have good manners, and do a good job. I am happy to pay the little above average rate for this service! 	Very polite treatment and reasonable price.  It's clean and considerate.  Personally, I'm grateful for the Thai massage using oil and balm. 	Good massage provided here. (Currently away, will definitely be back! Most polite service!!)  Finally back in Bangkok. Done 2hrs Thai Oil Massage last night.. Thanks Jeab! 	Very friendly and professional staff, spoke English well. Great massage. 	Wow very great place for peaceful  massage . Your tight muscles will be relax  after.  Wife and I love it and nice prices close to Bts 	Can I book tonight 7:30pm for 6people (Thai massage) 	Great place! Always have an above average massage here. Seems like all the masseuses are pretty well-trained which is nice.
