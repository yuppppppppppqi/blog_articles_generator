I ended up having the best Thai massage in all of Pattaya — and trust me, I get massages every other day! The staff are super nice and friendly. Can’t wait to come back! See u soon😎 … 	Quite a hit or Miss Place for a massage, randomly passed by and was the beautiful decor and set up of the place, so we got quite impressed. I had 2 massages in the past few days here, but the first one was much better than the second.  Chosen to do the foot, neck & shoulder massage, oddly there was loads of the time contributed to work on my arms and head and barely minutes on my shoulder and neck. I felt okay for the first time, hence the return, but the second left me lingered with not that great of an experience 	It’s located opposite to Alacazar with small parking lot. I tried the Thai massage was good. I made my 1st attempt here and met a therapist who could find out my pain points at my lower back! It was a great experience and I went there all the time. The environment is clean and tidy although the price is a bit higher than small stores on the streets. 	Beautiful interior at this spa with A/C.  Staff are friendly and they offer tea on arrival. I took the neck/shoulder/foot massage for 90 minutes.  After a foot wash I was taken to the massage chair studio.  My masseuse was very skilled and professional.  There were some loud tourists and staff members which ruined the atmosphere.  My suggestion is to close the doors to the massage chair room and encourage individuals to be quiet and respectful of others.  I was offered tea and a cookie once we were done :) I’d return the next time.	I had high hopes for Rinn Spa and Massage in Pattaya, given its spacious and neat ambiance. However, my experience fell far short of expectations. Despite opting for a full-body massage with scrub and a lengthy 2.5-hour session including a face massage, the quality of the massage was inconsistent.  Initially, the masseuses seemed competent, but their performance deteriorated after about 20 or 30 minutes into the session. The pace slowed down significantly, and the overall experience was not relaxing. Having tried similar massages in various spas around the world, including Thailand, I can confidently say that Rinn Spa and Massage did not meet the standard.  While the spa's appearance may be impressive, the quality of the massage service does not justify the expense or time. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking a genuinely rejuvenating massage experience. It was a disappointment and a waste of both time and money. 	Close to Runway night market. I went in for 1 hour massage with New, asked for medium hard massage and the massage was so good I extended for another 1 hour. Now I’m a regular at Rinn Spa, while I’m on holiday here in Pattaya, leave there fully relaxed after a day of exploring and touring the sites around Pattaya. 	Great Spa Studio. Clean and Cozy atmosphere. Tried the Aroma and Hot Stone body massage and the Head & Shoulder Foot Massage. Great experience overall. Would recommend and would try again if the opportunity comes. 	Such a good place to go get a relaxing massage i would highly recommend to anyone to come here then any of the street massages 100% better and relaxing and couldn’t stay awake best one ive been to so far 	Amazing massage!  Place was very clean, sheets were new and had no smell.  Highly recommend their MODERN THAI MASSAGE which was a combi of aroma and traditional thai massage minus the intense cracking, tossing and turning. Imagine long, hard, strong forearm and strokes on your back. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!! 	Amazing and relaxing experience. I got one of the packages, and I will be coming back in the future. The staff are really freindly and do an amazing job. 	Clean place and well design spa in Pattaya, very reasonable price with good massage. Was recommended by one of my friend and worth the try.  Recommended !! 	- Nice and clean place. - Good and welcoming staff. - Professional staff, that knows how to massage.  Will definitely come back. 	I had high expectations, but the experience was disappointing. I booked a 90-minute session, but only received a 60-minute massage. It wasn’t worth the price, and I wouldn’t recommend it. 	Very nice ,very polite,very demure Recommended 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻♾️/100 … 	Very beautiful studio, so prices are a little bit higher than in other studios around. It's my first thai massage, but I think it was good.  Closed room, not curtains. Temperature was also good.  They give me green tea before and after the massage:) 	4 people together. All of us say RINN Super good decoration, disappointing Thai massage. Techniques were poor; (mean and true is their massage feeling like mosquitoes on my skin…) 	I don't want to go again. I don't have good skills, but I get a high price. Whether it's desk staff or owner I don't know, but it's too unkind to the customer I am doing. Use a cheap massage shop nearby  It's a waste of a horoscope
