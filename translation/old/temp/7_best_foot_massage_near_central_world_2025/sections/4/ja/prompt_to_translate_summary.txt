The 90minutes foot massage was magnificient, I fell asleep, and my legs recovered from sourness. Massage staff name is Ya, very professional. I will visit again.🤗 … 	We enjoyed a one and a half hour Thai Traditional massage here. The experience was wonderful, with a friendly reception welcoming us upon arrival. The room was clean and had a quiet setting, making for a relaxing and rejuvenating massage. Thank you very much!🙏🏻😊 … 	I paid 650 for 90 min. It’s clean and relatively new inside. A bit cramped even and the first floor. Massage was good and soothing but she was light even though I ask for more strength. Nothing outstanding but they accommodated all 5 of us without an appointment. Average I would say but with Thai massage, even the nicest place with a bad masseuse can ruin the experience. I just didn’t have a good one here. If you like one, note her name and keep going back to her. That’s how you do it. 	A good massage place to go to. The masseur really massaged out the tension and knots in my shoulders. The environment was also really amazing - one of the best I've been to! Zen and relaxing. 	Best massage in Thalian so far!  Staff are friendly and experienced and salon is very clean.  Highly recommend 	It was such a great experience to book a massage at Pela Thai Massage to cap off your Thailand trip. They treated me really well! I enjoyed my pampering session. They had modern facilities and expert therapist. I’ll be back on my next Thailand trip! 	Very good massage. Very friendly staff, nice and clean places. Very recomended 👍🏻 … 	Amazing Thai Massage place! Booked for the 5 of us (via Klook) and reservation was seamless. The Staff were very accommodating and friendly. The lady who did my massage was very strong and friendly and made us tea afterwards.  Would highly recommend. 🙂 	This is a very relaxing massage and spa place. The facilities are so nice and look like Japanese style. The massage helps me relaxed my muscles a lot. I would recommend this place. 	I've been traveling for 20+ days so my body was entirely hurting specially my feet, after this massage I feel good as new. The service was amazing, everyone is really nice, the music and the smells are really soothing. It was the best massage I've ever had! 100% recommended. 	Excellent massage and service! Booked for 3 people and the receptionist was able to accommodate us. I purchased the Pela Signature Relax package. Without having to explain, the masseuse was able to identify problem areas quickly and loosen up the tension. The space is clean, relaxing, and welcoming. Highly recommend and will definitely return for more massages! 	Awesome service! Very nice and clean environment. Although it’s a bit pricier but it’s worth the price.  Brought my baby along and did the 6 in 1 therapy and it was so comfortable. The other lady came out to help me take care of my baby while I enjoy my massage which I greatly appreciate. 🥰🥰 	Relaxing massage and totally enjoyed it. Opted for the aromatic massage, 90mins with 1 for 1 promotion at 1,650 baht which is definitely a steal! Place was clean and quiet as well. Highly recommended. 	Wonderful experience!!!! All the service are good, the massages will keep confirming you are ok or not👍 Definitely will come back again!! … 	Truly amazing massage. They are dedicated to giving the best massage experience. Just a warning for foreigners. It will hurt during it, but afterwards you will feel amazing and relaxed. 	Comfortable and new environment. Massage was great! Would come back 	Super place!!! My husband and I did the "Aromatherapy oil massage with herbal compress" 60min and it was super nice!!. Worth it 100%. All the people was very nice and they offered us a hot thé after the massage. The girl on the front desk was very kind and helpful (her name was Jane). ;)
