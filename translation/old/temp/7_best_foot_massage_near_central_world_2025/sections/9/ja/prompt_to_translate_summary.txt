The atmosphere inside the shop is very beautiful and the service of the shop is very good. I got a private room, which is really suitable for relaxation. The room is very large and very clean. You can get a massage as a couple and there is a bathroom inside. You can take a shower before the massage and it is very comfortable. There are also clothes to change for the massage. As for the massage, the massage shop's crew is very professional and the massage skills are very good. It makes me feel relaxed. Most importantly, the shop's crew is very professional, safe and makes us worry-free throughout the massage. There are both male and female crews in the shop. You can choose. Let you feel comfortable and relaxed during the massage. And enjoy the smell of aroma oils. There are many scents to choose from before receiving the service. After the massage, I felt more comfortable than ever. It was the best. And finally, there is a herbal drink and a little snack after the massage. After leaving the shop, I felt more comfortable than ever and was very impressed. Everything that happened here was like heaven. I recommend that you spend at least 2 hours for the best comfort. You should come and try this shop for yourself. You will not be disappointed. And you will find comfort like never before. And of course, I will definitely come back. 	It was an absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish. The ambiance of the spa is incredibly calming, with soft lighting, soothing music, and a clean, relaxing environment.  The therapists are highly skilled and attentive, ensuring the perfect pressure and technique throughout the session. I opted for a Aromatic Stress Release Massage (2 hours), and it was one of the best I've ever had—thoroughly rejuvenating and left me feeling refreshed and energized.  The staff were warm and welcoming, offering tea after the session, which added a lovely touch to the overall experience. The pricing was very reasonable for the quality of service provided, making it an excellent value for money.  If you're looking for a place to unwind and truly relax, I highly recommend Nature. It’s a must-visit if you're in Bangkok! 	I was planing to have Thai massage since I have arrived to Thailand, and today chose this place, and no regrets at all. Very clean, professional and cozy place. Massage therapists are very friendly and high professionals. Highly recommended. They also have some welcome treatments and after massage nice tea and some sweets. All in all I’m satisfied. If you visit Bangkok, just take the metro to Siam Station, it’s very near to it. 	Great massage — very relaxing and professional. The therapist was skilled, listened to what I needed, and worked out all the tension. I felt amazing afterward. Highly recommend! 	One of the best experiences I had in Thailand. Truly amazing, from very moment you enter until you exit. Strong, professional and really nice personal. 	Great service! I felt so relaxed after my massage. The jasmine scent also smelled amazing. Thank you so much! 	I recently had an amazing foot massage! The atmosphere was relaxing, and the therapist knew exactly how to relieve my tension. My feet felt rejuvenated, and I left feeling so much better. Highly recommend it for some pampering! 	I'm so satisfied with the service. Booked the 5 in 1 massage for 90 minutes for reasonable price. The masseuse lady was strong and professional. Receptionist lady was so friendly. The room was spacious and private. Everything was clean and smelled really nice. They provide complementary drink and snack before and after service. 10/10. Recommended. 	Came for the Four Hands facial and foot massage (60min total but two people attend to you simultaneously) as was short on time. Massage rly hit the spot after long day of walking and facial was satisfactory. Paid 2,190 baht (S$80+) 	One of our favorite Thai massage place in the Siam area, it offers a green ambiance and nice aroma. The masseurs consistently provide satisfying service, I always liked to get the signature Thai and herbal ball massages. The place provided a 20% discount if you arrive before 5pm. I highly recommend booking ahead of time as it's conveniently located in Siam and can get busy. The front desk lady communicates fluently in English, Thai, and Chinese, always providing friendly service. The massage rooms are simply set up and consistently clean with a pleasant aroma that enhances the overall experience.	If you are looking for a real Thai massage experience, come to Nature Thai.  A super Affordable and quality massage. Deep tissue and after a lot of walking and sight seeing my feet feel all better.  The staff are incredibly friendly and sweet. Made me laugh a few times too. Come and bring your friends to impress them lol  You get tasty tea and coconut cookies at the end too 	I had a very great experience here. Definitely one of the best thai massage experiences in my life. Great location, Excellent service and reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!!! 	I booked a happy hour to get 20% off on the aroma massage today. The place is definitely on a higher price point, but the experience was worth it. You get a nice drink both before and after the massage. The place smells really nice, so you get into the full relax experience. The only one thing that disappointed me was the masseur wasn’t as skillful as I expected. She gave me a very relaxing time but didnt work on all the trigger point. 	Is my 1st time for Aroma Oil massage, feel nice and comfortable. Clean environment. 	Was served by a bob cut elderly lady for a 5-in-one therapy 1 hour.  Leg massage was decent. With attention to toe and feet pressure points. But the neck and back massage was one of the better ones I've ever had!  Small issue I had with the store was that the music had a high pitch sound due to the aux cable. They managed to adjust it after awhile.  Highly recommend! 	Nice place, very relaxing and massuers are polite. I had a good 90mins massage! 	A very pleasant experience. The service is top-notch and the facilities are clean and fragrant.
