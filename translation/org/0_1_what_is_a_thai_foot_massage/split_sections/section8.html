<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Do I *have* to tip?</strong><br>Nope, tipping isn't mandatory in Thailand like it is in some countries. <u>However</u>, it's very common and genuinely appreciated, especially for good service in places like massage shops. A small tip is a nice way to show thanks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Okay, so how much for an hour-long foot massage?</strong><br>A good rule of thumb is <strong><u>50–100 THB</u></strong> per hour of massage. Many people, myself included, find 100 THB (about $3 USD) to be a nice, easy amount for a great hour-long massage.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>What about shorter sessions, like 30 minutes?</strong><br>For a shorter massage, adjusting the tip makes sense. Somewhere around <strong><u>30–50 THB</u></strong> feels appropriate for the time and effort.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Is it better to tip a percentage or a flat amount?</strong><br>Both work! You could calculate <strong>10–15%</strong> of the massage cost (e.g., 30–45 THB for a 300 THB massage), or just stick with a flat amount like <u>50 or 100 THB</u> for simplicity. I usually go with the flat amount.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cash or card for the tip?</strong><br><strong><u>ALWAYS tip in cash!</u></strong> Hand it directly to the therapist who worked on you. Most smaller shops can't process tips added to credit card payments, so cash ensures your therapist actually receives it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>What if the massage wasn't great?</strong><br>Tips are for good service. If you genuinely weren't happy or felt uncomfortable, it's okay to leave a smaller tip (maybe <u>20–30 THB</u>) or even no tip, though the latter is quite uncommon unless it was truly bad.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>When do I give the tip?</strong><br>The best time is right at the end of your session, after you've gotten up and are maybe putting your shoes back on. Hand it directly to your therapist with a smile and a "thank you" ("Khop khun krap/ka"). <u>Direct and clear is best.</u></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>What if there's already a "service charge" on the bill?</strong><br>This usually only happens at very high-end hotel spas. If you see a <strong>10% service charge</strong> added automatically, you don't need to tip extra. If the service was exceptional, you could still give a small <u>20–30 THB</u> directly to the therapist if you wish.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Can I offend someone by tipping too much?</strong><br>Honestly, no. While Thai culture is generally modest, therapists appreciate generosity. Sticking to the <u>50-100 THB per hour</u> range is perfectly polite and won't cause any offense. You're showing appreciation!</li>
