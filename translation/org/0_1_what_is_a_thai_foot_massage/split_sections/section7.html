<p>Finding a great foot massage spot in Bangkok is easy, but finding an *amazing* one takes a little know-how.

<p>But here are a few things I always look for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Vibe Check (Location &amp; Ambiance):</strong> I prefer shops on main streets that look inviting. Look for comfy reclining chairs (not just hard stools!), soft lighting, and enough space between chairs. <u>Comfort and hygiene are key!</u></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cleanliness is Crucial:</strong> Take a quick peek inside. Do the floors, chairs, and towels look clean and well-kept? Therapists should definitely wash their hands or use sanitizer, and always use fresh towels for each customer. <strong>Non-negotiable for me.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Skillful Hands (Therapist Check):</strong> Watch how they work if you can. Look for therapists who apply clear, steady pressure and seem confident. A huge plus is if they check in with you about the pressure ("Okay? Too strong?"). Seeing certificates displayed is usually a good sign too. <u>Experience matters.</u></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>No Surprises (Transparent Pricing):</strong> Prices should be clearly posted somewhere – usually on a board outside or a menu inside. Expect that <strong><u>200–350 THB per hour</u></strong> range. If it seems way higher or lower, I might be a bit wary.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quick Online Check (Reviews):</strong> It only takes a minute to pull up Google Maps or TripAdvisor. A few recent reviews can tell you a lot – look for comments on cleanliness and therapist skill. It can save you from a bad experience! <strong>Trust the crowd (usually).</strong></li>
