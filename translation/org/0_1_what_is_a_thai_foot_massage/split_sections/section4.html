<p>Good question! A Thai foot massage really zones in on just your <u>feet, ankles, and lower legs</u>. You keep your clothes on, and the therapist uses their thumbs, fingers (and sometimes that little wooden stick I mentioned!) to press specific "Sen" energy lines, mainly on the soles of your feet.</p>

<li><strong>Full-Body vs. Feet Focus:</strong> A traditional Thai *body* massage is a whole different beast â€“ head-to-toe stretching and acupressure, usually without oil. The foot massage sticks to reflex points, and being oil-free lets them apply <strong>deeper, more precise pressure</strong> on bones and nerves.</li>

<li><strong>Precision Points vs. Flowing Strokes:</strong> Western styles like Swedish massage are all about long, flowing strokes, usually with oil. Thai foot massage is more about alternating <u>firm pressure on specific points</u> with gentle stretches. It creates this really mindful, almost meditative rhythm.</li>

<li><strong>Rhythm and Pace:</strong> Spa massages can sometimes feel a bit rushed or uniform. With Thai foot massage, you'll notice this unique ebb-and-flow rhythm. It really lets you focus on each spot as the tension melts away. <strong>It's a different kind of relaxation.</strong></li>
