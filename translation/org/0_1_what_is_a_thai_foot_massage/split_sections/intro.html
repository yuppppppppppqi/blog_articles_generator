<p>Okay, let's talk about something I've grown to absolutely <u>love</u> here in Bangkok: the <strong>Thai foot massage</strong>. It's not just any foot rub; it's a special kind of reflexology focusing on your feet, ankles, and lower legs. Trust me, it feels amazing.</p>

<p>The therapist uses their thumbs and fingers to press along these energy lines called "Sen" – you can really feel it! They also do some gentle stretches and rhythmic kneading that just melts the tension away.</p>

<p>What makes it different? Well, unlike those oily spa massages, most Thai places work on <u>dry feet</u>. This lets the therapist get a better feel for the bones and pressure points – sometimes it's intense, but in a good way! You just kick back in a comfy chair or sit on a mat, fully clothed, and tell them if you prefer gentle touches or something firmer. <strong>It's totally up to you.</strong></p>

<p>A lot of shops start you off with a <u>warm foot soak</u>, which is heavenly after walking around the city. Seriously, after a session, my feet feel so much lighter, and I always walk out feeling more energized.</p>
