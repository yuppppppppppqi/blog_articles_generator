<p>Okay, so these "pressure points" (or reflex points) are specific spots on your feet and lower legs that are believed to be connected to different organs, glands, and parts of your body. Think of them like a map on your feet!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These points follow those <strong>"Sen" energy lines</strong> I mentioned – it's a concept similar to meridians in traditional Chinese medicine. A good therapist knows exactly where these points are.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They use their thumbs, fingers, and sometimes that trusty wooden stick to apply <u>firm, steady pressure</u> on each point for a few seconds. The idea is to release blockages, ease tension, and get your body's energy flowing smoothly again.</p>
